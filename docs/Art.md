Designing visual elements of Hyperblade requires more than just a good idea; thorough understanding of color theory, shading, and the game asset pipeline are all required to produce consitent visuals inside the game. The aesthetics of Hyperblade are built from a set of fundamental principles that help keep each character immediately identifiable against the whimsical environment during the fast twitchy gameplay.
