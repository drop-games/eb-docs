# DAO Governance

_Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-sufficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do._

## Hyperblade DAO

Hyperblade DAO is the organization of **Spacerock** tokenholders as well other people interested in the success of the project, including Hyperblade players. The DAO controls Hyperblade (game), Spacerock & Timeore tokenomics, core Smart Contracts (including HB NFT contracts), Hyperblade Marketplace, as well as it self-manages it's own governance including voting mechanisms.

The future iterations of DAO governance will go beyond $SPR token voting, giving a voice to the rest of the community and especially the most involved and talented individuals who want to see the DAO prosper.

The initial decision making and day-to-day operations are carried out by the _core team_.
The team is the main force behind the development of the Hyperblade as well as the governing body for the DAO until _The Council_ will take the reign. For the purposes of incentivization, there is pre-allocated $SPR budget for the team members, as well as the contributing council members. $SPR received by the team will have a year lock-up period, where the largest receivers will also be subjects to a vesting schedule.

Further down the timeline there will be an option for other DAO members to directly participate in the building of Hyperblade, this will be done trough a task-management pipeline allowing for a distributed way of creating and fulfilling tasks regarding the development & management of the project, with results verified in a trustless manner and rewards paid out in cryptocurrency (ETH & $SPR)

The collaboration is done using channels such as _Discord_ or _Snapshot_, as well as any other suitable way to effectively communicate and advance the project forward.

## \$SPR Voting

Currently the main stakeholders in the DAO are \$SPR owners, and they are voting in council members to represent their interests.
All of their votes are counted in **quadratically**. This means that the real voting power of each voter equals square root of their **total** $SPR balance (i.e. wallet balance, staked and locked $SPR), this is done to make the elections democratic as it gets and to limit 'whale' influence on the outcome of elections. Tokenholders are incentivized to vote in elections with additional rewards like **NFT loot crate** drops, as well as they have option to delegate their voting power to some other tokenholder.
\$SPR has to be in the wallet for 1 month until it will be eligible for voting as a way to lessen the possible hostile voting attacks.

Another way for $SPR holders to influence where the project is going is by voting for **community created NFTs** that will be included in the game. The incentive for the voters to choose the best art pieces is a **higher drop rate** in loot crates and/or **portion of fees** from the sales of this NFT.

## The Council

Inspired by the system used by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/introducing-the-graph-council), $SPR tokenholders elect **the council of 7**, who are deemed the most suitable candidates to make high-level decisions regarding the protocol, Spacerock and DAO governance. The legitimacy, executive power, and compensation for the council is carried out using **smart contracts**, including on-chain voting. The election is held every 4 months via _Snapshot_, where candidates can be nominated at any time prior to that. The process of voting itself lasts 3 days, and after that the candidates with the most votes automatically receive the seat at the council.

The core purpose of the council is to vote on **Hyperblade Improvement Proposals**, where the council member votes will have an equal weight and the outcome is decided by a _simple majority_.

Council members will be compensated for their efforts with extra $SPR and stable-coins, both coming out the DAO treasury. If a council member resigns or is removed an unscheduled election for a vacant chair can be held.

## Hyperblade Improvement Proposals

**Hyperblade Improvement Proposals** or _HIP_ are submitted by DAO members and include motions how to change the platform. The proposition can range from basic issues like how a certain logo looks to pressing matters regarding staking, market mechanisms or treasury management.

All of the HIPs will be visible on _Snapshot_, where the vote will be held by the council. The whole voting process is transparent to prevent collusion and to promote healthy project development.

## The Future of DAO

Hyperblade is on a verge of disrupting how games are being made and how community can be involved in this process. And this is why the project has to stay in the forefront of technology innovation as well as utilize the most fair government system available. And as result, experimenting with the way the DAO is managed is necessary.

Hyperblade has to give players who actually play the game a voice and a way to change the direction the project is going. In the future, players could vote on the gameplay issues like balance or content updates, possibly utilizing a separate non-monetary token to reflect the players' voting power. _We envision DAO being fairly managed with all of the stakeholders being equitably represented._

## NFT Voting

Functioning essentially as a _prediction market_, player vote with their token for the NFTs from a pool of community created NFTs they like (possibly even wagering their $SPR). If the NFT gets sufficient amount of votes, passing the threshold, it will be approved for both Hyperblade and it's marketplace, assigned common values like rarity or collection, and become available amongst other NFTs on an equal basis. The creator of this NFT gets a fair share of the profits yielded from this item, and players who actually voted for the NFT are rewarded with price discounts or higher drop rate of this item. This way players are motivated to vote for the available items, and Hyperblade gets the most quality art pieces created by it's own community.
