# Hyperblade DAO Governance

### Why DAO?

What made us go with the blockchain route is the current situation in the gaming industry where players have basically no control over the game they play, as well as no real in-game asset ownership (items can be permanently removed and banned players lose everything they got). The sole cause of this is a centralized economy that is fully controlled by the developer coming with only one official point of sale and limited/forbidden item & account resale. What this boils to is an economy that has no price-regulation and infinite/unrestricted asset emission, which in turn can lead to an unexpected inflation and items being now worhtless. Those kind of in-game economies are also tied to one particular game (best case, a franchise), so the items are rendered useless outside of it. Finally, the reality that the game can be simply closed down by the developer/IP owner (which happened to still popular multiplayer titles like _Need for Speed: World_ or _Battlefield Heroes_), shows that players are perceived only as a source of income, and barelly something else.

We mitigated the issues listed above by going the blockchain way. Real ownership and true item scarcity are now guaranteed by the smart-contract and blockchain integrity. Item-owners are permitted to do anything with their items, even outside of the game ecosystem. Matter of a fact, it is in DAO's interest that the players are trading/gambling/staking/leasing their items, as this generates market fees and therefore revenue. Hyperblade's inherit openness leads to greater adoption with more people flocking to see what is going on, creative individuals coming to expand the universe, and talented developers building interesting third party tools, possibly even forking the game.

Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-sufficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do. We're whole digital ecosystem that includes an easy fiat on/off-ramp, peer-to-peer marketplace, earning platform, creative suite and more we want to reach to as many people as we can, showing them that gaming can be done differently now.

Hyperblade is the first project of Drop Games/Drop DAO

Drop Games Inc., was founded in August 2019 in New York by **Tim** & **Theo**.

In 2021 it became obvious that the proper way to manage Hyperblade and subsequent projects is through a community driven DAO. The reasoning behind is that majority of the game studios always focuses only on the upcoming projects, where the old ones become only cash-cow and get no proper QOL support.

Other than that, Hyperblade's NFT structure strongly involves both the creators and the actual playerbase. See more in the NFT section

Governance is this and that

This path relies on: community control over the ecosystem and economy, planned/transparent issuance, free-for-all participation even in creation and development, forks (new projects/mods), project lifecycle not ending with company closing the project (as long as there are people participating, the project will live), meritocracy for creators/developers, player-empowerment, resistance to censorship.

Hyperblade DAO is an organization of $SPR tokenholders. The governance is done by voting for proposals submitted by the DAO members. Currently, it will be a council of 7 voted-in

Quadratic voting. Voting is available after 1 month from when u get token.
