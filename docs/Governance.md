# DAO Governance

_Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-sufficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do. We want to reach to as many people as we can, showing them that gaming can be done differently now._

## Hyperblade DAO

Hyperblade DAO is the organization of **Spacerock** tokenholders as well other people interested in the project, including Hyperblade players.
The future iterations of DAO governance will go beyond $SPR token voting, giving a voice to the rest of the community and especially the most involved and talented individuals who want to see the DAO prosper.

The initial decision making and day-to-day operations are carried out by the _core team_.
The team is the main force behind the development of the Hyperblade as well as the governing body for the DAO until _The Council_ will take the reign. For the purposes of incentivization, there is pre-allocated $SPR budget for the team members. $SPR received by the team will have a year lock-up period, where the biggest receivers will also be subjects to a vesting schedule.

Further down the timeline there will be an option for other DAO members to directly participate in the building of Hyperblade, this will be done trough a task-management pipeline allowing anybody to submit their work on any active task in the system.

The collaboration is done using channels such as _Discord_ or _Snapshot_, as well as any other suitable way to effectively communicate and move the project forward.

## \$SPR Voting

Currently the main stakeholders in the DAO are \$SPR owners, and they are voting in council members to represent their interests.
All of their votes are counted in **quadratically**. This means that the real voting power of each voter equals square root of their **total** $SPR balance (i.e. wallet balance, staked and locked $SPR), this is done to make the elections democratic as it gets and to limit 'whale' influence on the outcome of elections. Tokenholders are incentivised to vote in elections with additional rewards like **NFT loot crate** drops, as well as they have option to delegate their voting power to some other tokenholder.
\$SPR has to be in the wallet for 1 month until it will be elegible for voting as a way to lessen the possible hostile voting attacks.

Another way for $SPR holders to influence where the project is going is by voting for **community created NFT** that will be included in the game. The incentive for the voters to choose the best art pieces is a **higher drop rate** in loot crates and/or **portion of fees** from the sales of this NFT.

## The Council

<TextStyled fontWeight="bold">The Graph like council</TextStyled>
\$SPR tokenholders vote in **the council of 7**, who are deemed the most suitable candidates to make high-level decisions regarding the protocol, Spacerock and DAO governance. Everything council-wise is done using **smart contracts** including on-chain voting. The election is held every 4 months via _Snapshot_, where candidates can be nominated at any time prior to that. The process of voting itself lasts 3 days, and after that the candidates with the most votes automatically receive the seat at the council.
The core purpose of the council is to vote on **Hyperblade Improvement Proposals**, where the council member votes will have an equal weight and the outcome is decided by a _simple majority_.

Council members will be compensated for their efforts with extra $SPR and stable-coins, both coming out the DAO treasury. If a council member resigns or is removed an unscheduled election for a vacant chair can be held.

## Hyperblade Improvement Proposals

Hyperblade Improvement Proposals or HIP are submitted by DAO members and include motions how to change the platform. Those proposition can range from something basic like how the logo looks to global issues regarding staking, market mechanisms or treasury management.

All of the HIPs will be visible on _Snapshot_, and this is where the vote will be held by the council. The whole voting process is transparent to prevent collusion and to promote healthy project development.

## The Future of DAO

As a true blockchain project Hyperblade is on a verge of disrupting how games are being made and how community can be involved in the making of them. And this is why we want to constantly evolve both the technology as well as how the goverenance is carried out. This is why we are all for experimenting with the way the DAO is managed. We want to give players who actually play the game a voice and a way to change the direction the project is going. In the future, players could vote on the gameplay issues like balance or content updates. We envision DAO being fairly managed with all of the stakeholders being equitably represented.
