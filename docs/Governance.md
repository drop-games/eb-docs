# DAO Governance

_Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-sufficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do._

## Hyperblade DAO

Hyperblade DAO is the organization of **Spacerock** tokenholders as well as other people interested in the success of the project, including Hyperblade players.
The cornerstone of Hyperblade DAO is a series of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum network that allow DAO members to oversee Spacerock & Timeore tokenomics, development of Hyperblade game, key infrastructure (e.g. HB Marketplace), as well as the governance system itself.
By giving every participant a voice and ability to influece the direction the project is going, the DAO is empowering the community and allowing it to be a self-managed and self-sustaing movement that is closer to a nation state than a corporation, prioritizing satisfaction of it's participants to over-monetization and pure for-profit attitude.

## Core Team & Initial Governance

During the period of governance decentralization, the decision making and day-to-day operations are carried out by **Drop Games Inc.**, _the core team_, tasked with development Hyperblade game and the necessary infrastructure. Secondly, core team is responsible for the customer service and in-game moderation, essential for great user experience and player retention.
The core team will be superseded as the main governing body by **the Council**, a board of 7 elected representatives of $SPR tokenholders.

For the purpose of incentivization, there is a pre-allocated $SPR budget for team members and contributing council members. $SPR received by the team will have a year lock-up period, and the largest receivers will also be subjects to a vesting schedule. Futher down the timeline, the core team will be absorbed by the DAO itself, and the **Dev Council** will be established to supervise talent acquisition and appropriate compensation for each collaborator.

## Distributed Organizational Structure

Further down the timeline there will be an option for other DAO members to directly participate in the building of Hyperblade using a task-management pipeline allowing for a distributed way of creating and fulfilling tasks regarding the development & management of the project, with results verified in a trustless manner and rewards paid out in cryptocurrency (ETH/Stablecoins & $SPR).

The crucial distinction between Hyperblade and similar but centralized projects is how Hyperblade is able to utilize an unlocked talent pool, where people who otherwise won't be able to contribute due to lack of formal credentials, physical location & work-hours concerns are now empowered. The common goal of driving the platform forward, ability to set the direction the DAO is taking, democratized on-boarding process, and tokenized compensation give Hyperblade DAO an opportunity to be all-inclusive, endorsing the most driven and talented individuals. Decentralized, online-first Web3 infrastructure that underpins the collaboration framework further accentuates the new way of organically developing innovative and artistic projects. The community is now building the platform for themselves, possibly taking it far beyond a simple gaming project that it was initially.

## \$SPR Voting

The first iteration of the DAO features trustless quadratic voting via _Snapshot_, where one's voting power is equal to the square root of their $SPR balance (both locked and unlocked) and voting power that was delegated to them by other $SPR holders.
Quadratic voting is introduced to thwart oligarchy (i.e. major $SPR holders colliding to control the decision-making), active participation in DAO voting is rewarded with additional **NFT Loot Crates**, and \$SPR has to be in the wallet for 1 month until it will be eligible for voting. Futhermore, the unused $SPR held in the DAO treasury does not have voting power until it's distributed. The aforementioned mechanics are implemented to support the broad distribution of political power and to mitigate any possible hostile actions, whether by third-parties or bad actors in the DAO itself.

In the future, DAO has to consider shifting away from $SPR token voting to more advanced methods of governance as they become available in order to maintain long-term sustainability and community-first approach.

## The Council

Inspired by the system used by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/introducing-the-graph-council), $SPR tokenholders elect **the council of 7**, who are deemed the most suitable candidates to make high-level decisions regarding the project and DAO governance, ultimately representing the interests of all $SPR tokenholders. The legitimacy, executive power, and individual compensation are guaranteed by **smart contracts**. The election process and possible term limits are also established by smart contracts, yet due to the risks of power corruption the authority over those contracts is reserved for $SPR holders who have to approve any changes to those contracts via voting.
Candidates for the council can be nominated at any time prior to the vote, the election itself takes 3 days after which the 7 leading candidates are automatically appointed to the council and commence their duties.
The subsequent elections are then held every 4 months, and if any council seat becomes vacant, a snap election for this position then takes place.
Council members will be compensated for their efforts with pre-approved $SPR and/or ETH/stable-coins coming out DAO treasury, Spacerock earned this way will locked for 6 months in a yield generating contract.

## Hyperblade Improvement Proposals

**Hyperblade Improvement Proposal**, or **HIP**, is essentially a motion to change the Hyperblade platform.
DAO members submit their proposals on HIP GitHub repository where discussion takes place and HIP is being collaborativelly drafted, the original author then finalizes the HIP.
Depending on the urgency, HIPs are either batched together for an ordinary voting session or voted-on in an emergency session.

HIPs in the current DAO iteration are then subject to an open vote by **the Council** where the outcome is decided by a _simple majority_, i.e. 4 out of 7 (or 3 out of 5) votes are needed for the HIP to be adopted. A successful HIP is then implemented by the team in accordance with it's conditions.

<ul className="list-enlarged">
	<li>Logo redesign</li>
	<li>Third-party NFT offering on HB Marketplace</li>
	<li>Tournament sponsorship</li>
	<li>In-game balance revision</li>
	<li>A request for a new Hyperblade game-mode</li>
	<li>Research & Development of a new project</li>
	<li>Funding for a partnered entity</li>
	<li>Acquisition of a project</li>
	<li>Duel-to-Earn rewards adjustment</li>
	<li>Modification of Staking/Liquidity Providing conditions</li>
	<li>$SPR tokenomics correction</li>
	<li>Changes to DAO governance</li>
	<li>Licensing proposals</li>
</ul>

All of the HIPs will be visible on _Snapshot_, where the vote will be held by the council. The whole voting process is transparent to prevent collusion and to promote healthy project development.

## NFT Voting

Spacerock tokenholders are able to directly vote for NFTs. The incentive for the voters to choose the best art pieces is a **higher drop rate** in loot crates and/or **portion of fees** from the sales of this NFT.

Functioning essentially as a _prediction market_, player vote with their token for the NFTs from a pool of community created NFTs they like (possibly even wagering their $SPR). If the NFT gets sufficient amount of votes to pass the threshold, it will be approved for Hyperblade and assigned common values like rarity or collection, after that it will be available on par with other NFTs in the game and HB Marketplace. The creator of this NFT then gets a fair share of the profits yielded, and players who voted for this NFT are rewarded with price discounts or higher drop rate for this item. This way players are motivated to vote for the best items, and Hyperblade gets the top quality art pieces created by it's own community.

## The Future of DAO

Hyperblade is on a verge of disrupting how games are being made and how community can be involved in this process. The project has to stay in the forefront of technology innovation as well as transition to the most equitable and meritocratic governance system available. And as result, experimenting with the way the DAO is managed is necessary.

Hyperblade has to give players who actually play the game a voice and a way to change the direction the project is going. In the near future, players will vote on gameplay issues like balance or content updates, possibly utilizing a separate non-monetary token to reflect the players' voting power, again adding to a better player experience.
