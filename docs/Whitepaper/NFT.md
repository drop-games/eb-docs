# NFTs

NFTs in HyperBlade

Hyperblade NFTs are both non-fungible and semi-fungible (following ERC-1155 specification), where there is still a limited number of items available for purchase

Spacerocks can be used to purchase NFTs, players own the NFTs they have and they are able to do anything with them, even use them in different games

HB NFTs are always playable in the game, but also viewable outside of the game, with our push for total decentralization NFTs will be stored (stored as in, not just hash/metadata, but the model and such) on decentralized platforms such as IPFS.

Permanent NFTs, cwrtain nfts can be tied (welded!) to other NFT by burning it, think you can buy lighting aura for your sword (it could be multipe types of items) and then permanently attach them to that NFT. This can essentially change the aimed NFT, accessory can be removed using a 'plain NFT'?. Modified NFTs aim to have a different price building structure.:wa:

### Drop Games Designed NFTs

First NFTs in HyperBlade are designed by the Drop Games, those will set the standards on how the NFTs should look and play like. Our NFTs will be scarce and rare.

### Community Designed NFTs

Creators design NFTs, community votes for them using $SPR. If the item is voted in, then it becomes available on the NFT marketplace and creator gets cut from the sale (and subsequent resales) of this item.

Tim's idea: you vote for something and you get share from the sales. Voters should be insentivized to choose good shit, and not just anything for the sake of it. Balance between quantity of this sNFT and quality

## NFT Types

There are various types of NFT availible inside and outside of the game

### Swords

Start with a basic wooden sword, then mutate it (to katana, tanto, hammer etc), sometimes u get a rarish wooden sword (like with blue flames or some shit)
Obtain full swords from the market, or rare drops (match win), win them from other players or pools
Breedable (not in the retarded Cryptokitties way lmao)! Spend guap to breed them, or buy/earn them outright. All of that (de)generative art is like gen1 of the whole shit, tbh I don't think adding new features should be that problem even retroactively
Use on any character, have different randomly generated characteristics features etc (CSGO)
Collectible shit
Different combos/animations needed -> swords vs hammers. i.e Drop DAO would create tasks for new shit and then it becomes an option to select this type on sword creation.
Melt swords? (burning the NFT)
Each sword has history (wins n shit)

### Armor & Character Accessories

Player model like in Morrowind (dress it up)
Character specific
Sets, create your own sets, sell as a collection
Non-fungible and semi fungible (1 of 8 etc), pre-configured
Couldd be only visual/vanity (doesn't have to be gameplay affecting)

### Other

Shit like banners, UI, essentially useless vanity shit that should tell everybody how cool you are

Custom Map skins as NFT

### Dojo

NFT real estate, very limited, decorate with HB NFTs (Armory & Sword collection), as well as with your own non-HB NFTs - jpeg paintings etc., these can be lent to/from other people. Expand by paying hefty $$ or winning games. Invite other people to visit, if the space allows you can bring in other people to visit

## NFT Collections & Themes

Items are often for the sake of consistency pooled together in a collection, which is a series of itmes that share common style/properties. It is possible for one item to be a part of multiple collections. Sell the whole collection to get more profit? (remember in Morrowind when you were missing just one cauldron from the whole set?)

## NFT Marketplace

Hyperblade NFTs will be available both on third party market placeces such as Rarible, OpenSea and such, as well as the Drop Marketplace (TBA).

NFTs - utility, art, limited
