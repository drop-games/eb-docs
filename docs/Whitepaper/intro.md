# Introduction

Hyperblade is the first game that is connecting real gamers and the world of blockchain.

The development started in 2019 as the 'Project Blade' and, right from the beginning the goal was to create a game with super low entry barrier, yet amazing replayablity and competitive edge to it. Blockchain brought a big twist on how the game is being made, as well as the fact that players can now be empowered to have a say and stake in the game they play. Right now (September 2021), the game is in it's alpha stage with full release being scheduled for 2022.

## Core concept

We are on the verge of disruptiong the gaming/tech industry and here is how we are going to do it:

Hyperblade is a competitive free-to-play sword fighting game designed with e-sports and cross-play in mind as well as a tool for the players to earn real life income simply by playing the game they like.

But we are not developing only a game, Hyperblade is a whole new ecosystem built around the idea that games are just a source of revenue for the developers. We took a whole new approach of putting together decentralization and openness of blockchain and a game that will be actually fun to play. The govenance is done through a a Hyperblade DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization and all revenues are split between the holders of the Spacerock ($SPR) token. By doing all of this and giving up the rights for the game to a DAO, we want to ensure our players that it's them who matter the most.

Spacerock is the basis of the complex economy that Hyperblade is the cornerstone of. Players earn Spacerock by directly playing the game, participating in DAO voting, or staking the token in a pool (and providing liquidity to the token, making it valuable outside of the HB ecosystem). Token holders will receive a share of revenues coming from the token usage, meaning sales on Hyperblade marketplace, fees from NFT resales, and other. Hyperblade marketplace is the way creatives can participate in building Hyperblade unierse and earning income for the NFTs they make and players buy. Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-suficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do. By building a whole ecosystem that includes an easy fiat on/off-ramp, peer-to-peer marketplace, earning platform, creative suite, and e-sports $platform$ and more we want to reach to as many people as we can, showing them that gaming can be done differently now, and players are not only the consumers anymore, they are they one in charge now.

## The Game

Hyperblade is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines our world with a sci-fi fantasy universe, featuring a completely original and compelling narrative, with tons of world-building, revolving around martial arts and melee weapons.

A g

The game itself is a third-person fighter, where the players are dueling with various melee weapons ranging from katana-like swords to warhammers and alebards, the dynamics of the game can be compared to the likes of Tekken, Mortal Kombat or Super Smash Bros. The inputs are precise and allow for competitve battles that require true skill to be the among the best, but at the same time the controls are simple enough that even when the game will be available on other platforms than PC, console and mobile players won't feel any disadvantage versus the mouse and keyboard players. Skill and knowledge of the game are the only things that give one player the edge of his opponents. All of this, as well as blockchain integration will allow Hyperblade to be the top esports game in no time.

Duel to Earn
Community owned, DAO governance, players are involved in governance and receive a share from the earnings (they duel to earn, then stake their tokens)
Hyperblade = Blade Symphony with NFTs

Game First. Everything else is built as an infrastructure around it. Game must be fun to play. Game must be playable and accessible.

You fight opponenets with swords and earn monies that you can spend on NFTs n shit, players own their NFTS and are able to do anything with em.

Hyperblade was concieved in 2019 as the Project Blade, inspired heavily by the likes of this and that

This is a cool game because its on Unreal 5 and its free-to-play and will be opensource with fucking blockchain and NFT.

Connect with your metamask account, download the game **_Duel to earn_**

The point of this game is for players to enjoy the gameplay, posibilities to earn are just as important for the sake of us getting rich.

## Blockchain

True blockchain gaming is the culmination of **Achievements/Item Ownership/User driven developement** trends withing gamedev of the last 15 years, along with **Decentralization/Permisionlessness/Determinism** of the blockchain

Blockchain game is not only about having NFTs, but also about the game being deterministic because of the blockchain as well as allowing everything to be fair and safe

**BLOCKCHAIN BULLETPOINTS**

Before Blockchain: no player control over the game, no real asset ownership (items removed, players banned -> lost access to everything), unbalanced economy/infinite item emission/(unexpected inflation), centralized issuance/point of sale, all items tied to one game (franchise in the best case), limited/forbidden resale, project abandonment (or closing NFS: World/Battlefield Heroes)

With Blockchain: safety of items guarranted by blockchain & smart-contracts, owners of items are permitted to do anything they want with their items (outside of the game ecosystem, if the game is not opensource/DAO controlled), resale of items or whole accounts permitted (likely with % fee going to the creator and/or platform owner), third-party marketplaces, limited issuance creating non-false scarcity

DAO Governance additionally allows: community control over the ecosystem and economy, planned/transparent issuance, free-for-all participation even in creation and development, forks (new projects/mods), project lifecycle not ending with company closing the project (as long as there are people participating, the project will live), meritocracy for creators/developers, player-empowerment, resistance to censorship

**NFT**

NFTs on L2 exchange _(not Immutable X cause its shit)_, created by Drop DAO and creators. Trade on any exchange, including Drop Marketplace. Drop Treasury receives portion from all sales in the ecosystem

All of this shit is on Layer 2 of Ethereum blockchain providing fast and painless way to interact with blockchain. Fast, cheap, easy, secure.

NFTs are ERC-1155, semifungible (think of Pokémon Charizard card), could be a part of a collection. Drop DAO NFT standart allows players to import Hyperblade NFTs into other games and vice versa, as well as NFTs having different styling versions (TBA), _what about ability to buy support for your NFT in different game?_

NFTs will not be gameplay affecting (for the sake of balance), but can accrue history or new parameters as the player uses it ingame

During the Drop Games HyperBlade custody period it will be Drop Games releasing NFTs in a conservative and sustainable manner, later on community NFTs will be voted in by the DAO/governing mechanism. DG will be selling those NFTs to bring early revenue/establish NFT standarts/for the purpose of lore building.

The amount of NFTs will be always finite, as NFTs are one part of the HB economy equilibrium

NFTs can have (hash) generated variants based on them, like for example a helmet can have color variations, different types of horns and ornaments, how weared they are, all based on the generated signature (0x), think CSGO

NFTs (and $SPR) can be burned and gambled. Play for items with other players when you duel, or bet on other players games.

_sending a token to the zero address will burn ANY token there is afaik_

---

Spacerock $SPR governance token, earned by staking/playing/NFT trade/completing tasks in Hypergraph. Keep your shit staked for set periods of time to earn even more $$$ (or even nfts!), LIST MORE INCENTIVES FOR PRICE TO MOON

Decentralized game with it's own universe, we aim for the players and creators to become the owners of the platform itself. Tokenholders will be able to participate in voting/creating tasks/get a revenue share (coming primary from sales fees/nft creation fees/yield farming/classic revenue stream)

Tokens are released in accordance with the schedule, promoting player-base ownership and decentralization.

Play to earn (how to get token), which incentivises players to play lol:
duel to earn
scheduled tourneys
participating in stuff like - voting (gov and NFT)
rewards for minting/creating NFT
reimbursing marketplace fees

In the near future, Drop DAO will be fully self managed as it should be all through Hypergraph.
Hypergraph is Drop's bleeding edge free-for-all project management platform, where tasks are linked in nodes. Earn $SPR by completing tasks (via Drop DAO)

Token Allocation & Release schedule:

1. DROP DAO Treasury
2. DROP Games (Drop corporation)
3. Market Sale (whether private/public)
4. Some mfers (advisors?)

Drop DAO allocates $SPR for:

1. Internal HB Economy
2. Token economy

x. Third party incentives (voted in by DAO)

**Voting:** \
Initally it's Drop Games calling all the shots, later the community will take the rule through the DAO

HOWEVER - it's actual players who should be guiding where the game goes gameplay-wise, since it's them who play the game
Voting on NFTs can involve $SPR holders

Quadratic voting with delegation is the preferred way of voting

**ELO Token:** \
Proposed idea: player-participation token - think ELO score, when players play the game they earn the token -> finishing matches, winning over better opponents in ranked, leaderboard with the list of players rated by ELO token. fixed rate hyperinflation (tokens earned this year will have half the voting power compared to the amount of tokens you'd earn by playing/winning the same amount of matches the next year) you can vote (quadratically) with this token, this leads to active players being able to participate in game-balance affecting decisions. Token is non-transferable (you can't sell it), but you can delegate your token to players you choose (i.e. select the player on the leaderboard with the same playstyle and give him your voting power).

## Roadmap

Well do tons of good shit over the time

##

Enter the game

At first (semi-closed game), there should be some capital reuquirement to play the game, which should be eventually lowered or abolished (after all we want to have a game thats accessible for all)
