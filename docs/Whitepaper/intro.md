# Introduction

Hyperblade is this and that, developed by us, and it will be the best

## Core concept

Hyperblade = Blade Symphony with NFTs

Game First. Everything else is built as an infrastructure around it. Game must be fun to play. Game must be playable.

Hyperblade was concieved in 2019 as the Project Blade, inspired heavily by the likes of this and that

You fight opponenets with swords and earn monies that you can spend on NFTs n shit, players own their NFTS and are able to do anything with em.

This is a cool game because its on Unreal 5 and its free-to-play and will be opensource with fucking blockchain and NFT.

Connect with your metamask account, download the game **_Duel to earn_**

The point of this game is for players to enjoy the gameplay, posibiliries to earn are just as important for the sake of us getting rich.

## Blockchain

True blockchain gaming is the culmination of **Achievements/Item Ownership/User driven developement** trends withing gamedev of the last 15 years, along with **Decentralization/Permisionlessness/Determinism** of the blockchain

Blockchain game is not only about having NFTs, but also about the game being deterministic because of the blockchain as well as allowing everything to be fair and safe

NFTs on L2 exchange _(not Immutable X cause its shit)_, created by Drop DAO and creators. Trade on any exchange, including Drop Marketplace _(for Tim: this shit should be eazy af)_. Drop Treasury receives portion from all sales in the ecosystem

All of this shit is on Layer 2 of Ethereum blockchain providing fast and painless way to interact with blockchain. Fast, cheap, easy, secure.

NFTs are ERC-1155, semifungible (think of Pok√©mon Charizard card), could be a part of a collection. Drop DAO NFT standart allows players to import Hyperblade NFTs into other games and vice versa, as well as NFTs having different styling versions (TBA), _what about ability to buy support for your NFT in different game?_

NFTs will not be gameplay affecting (for the sake of balance), but can accrue history or new parameters as the player uses it ingame

NFTs (and $SPR) can be burned and gambled. Play for items with other players when you duel, or bet on other players games.

_sending a token to the zero address will burn ANY token there is afaik_

During the Drop Games HyperBlade custody period it will be Drop Games releasing NFTs in a conservative and sustainable manner, later on community NFTs will be voted in by the DAO/governing mechanism. DG will be selling those NFTs to bring early revenue/establish NFT standarts/for the purpose of lore building

NFTs can have (hash) generated variants based on them, like for example a helmet can have color variations, different types of horns and ornaments, how weared they are, all based on the generated signature (0x), think CSGO

Spacerock $SPR governance token, earned by staking/playing/NFT trade/completing tasks in Hypergraph. Keep your shit staked for set periods of time to earn even more $$$ (or even nfts!), LIST MORE INCENTIVES FOR PRICE TO MOON

Decentralized game with it's own universe, we aim for the players and creators to become the owners of the platform itself. Tokenholders will be able to participate in voting/creating tasks/get a revenue share (coming primary from sales fees/nft creation fees/yield farming/classic revenue stream)

Tokens are released in accordance with the schedule, promoting player-base ownership and decentralization.

Play to earn (how to get token), which incentivises players to play lol:
duel to earn
scheduled tourneys
participating in stuff like - voting (gov and NFT)
rewards for minting/creating NFT
reimbursing marketplace fees

In the near future, Drop DAO will be fully self managed as it should be all through Hypergraph.
Hypergraph is Drop's bleeding edge free-for-all project management platform, where tasks are linked in nodes. Earn $SPR by completing tasks (via Drop DAO)

Token Allocation & Release schedule:

1. DROP DAO Treasury
2. DROP Games (Drop corporation)
3. Market Sale (whether private/public)
4. Some mfers (advisors?)

Drop DAO allocates $SPR for:

1. Internal HB Economy
2. Token economy

x. Third party incentives (voted in by DAO)

**Voting:**
Initally it's Drop Games calling all the shots, later the community will take the rule through the DAO
HOWEVER - it's actual players who should be guiding where the game goes gameplay-wise, since it's them who play the game
Voting on NFTs can involve $SPR holders

Quadratic voting with delegation is the preferred way of voting

## Roadmap
