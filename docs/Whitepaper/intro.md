# Introduction

Hyperblade is - core concept, core gameplay, explaning basic shit (TLDR), one full page cca 3 paragraphs include the buzzwords, some custom made visuals
Game - gameplay, story, mechanics, controls, art style (hydrant) stages, weapons, customization (images with different customizations on character model, incl variants), list/link roadmap topics
Blockchain & Economy - Drop Games -> Drop DAO, player ownership, $SPR (how to earn, what to do w it), NFT, complex economy, security, accessibility, unblockable. revenue model (burning shit),
Technical part - how the game is built, UE5, contracts, risks,
Roadmap - the plan, stages, release dates, future/ideas -> game modes & social shit (dojos?), single player & campaign, more user created stuff like arenas etc. Path to decentralization
Drop DAO - drop games, the team, governance is already in blockchain & economy, HYPERGRAPH (HB turned into components)

Cool shit - Gambling (token & nft), Self-hosted tourneys, Launcher, Store,

Buzzwords: UE5, Free-to-Play, Cross-play & Cross-Platform, Mobile, Blockchain, Ethereum, Level 2, Token, NFT, DAO, open source, divine intellect, stylized

Experimental: deterministic gameplay (blockchain verified), switch from client<->server to client<->blockchain(incl server)

## Core concept

Hyperblade = Blade Symphony with NFTs

<!-- Dis a joke chill the fuck out -->

Hyperblade was concieved in 2019 as the Project Blade, inspired heavily by the likes of this and that

You fight opponenets with swords and earn monies that you can spend on NFTs n shit, players own their NFTS and are able to do anything with em.

This is a cool game because its on Unreal 5 and its free-to-play and will be opensource with fucking blockchain and NFT.

Connect with your metamask account, download the game **_Duel to earn_**

The point of this game is for players to enjoy the gameplay, posibiliries to earn shjould be always secondary.

## Blockchain

Blockchain game is not only about having NFTs, but also about the game being deterministic because of the blockchain as well as allowing everything to be

NFTs on L2 exchange (not Immutable X cause its shit), created by Drop DAO and creators. Trade on any exchange, including Drop Marketplace (for Tim: this shit should be eazy af). Drop Treasury receives portion from all sales in the ecosystem

All of this shit is on Layer 2 of Ethereum blockchain providing fast and painless way to interact with blockchain. Fast, cheap, easy, secure.

NFTs are ERC-1155, semifungible (think of Pok√©mon Charizard card), could be a part of a collection. Drop DAO NFT standart allows players to import Hyperblade NFTs into other games and vice versa, as well as NFTs having different styling versions (TBA), _what about ability to buy support for your NFT in different game?_

NFTs can have (hash) generated variants based on them, like for example a helmet can have color variations, different types of horns and ornaments, how weared they are, all based on the generated signature (0x), think CSGO

Spacerock $SPR governance token, earned by staking/playing/NFT trade/completing tasks in Hypergraph.

Decentralized game with it's own universe, we aim for the players and creators to become the owners of the platform itself. Tokenholders will be able to participate in voting/creating tasks/get a revenue share

Tokens are released in accordance with the schedule, promoting player-base ownership and decentralization.

In the near future, Drop DAO will be fully self managed as it should be all through Hypergraph.
Hypergraph is Drop's bleeding edge free-for-all project management platform, where tasks are linked in nodes. Earn $SPR by completing tasks (via Drop DAO)
