## Core concept

Hyperblade = Blade Symphony with NFTs

<!-- Dis a joke chill the fuck out -->

Hyperblade was concieved in 2019 as the Project Blade, inspired heavily by the likes of this and that

You fight opponenets with swords and earn monies that you can spend on NFTs n shit, players own their NFTS and are able to do anything with em.

This is a cool game because its on Unreal 5 and its free-to-play and will be opensource with fucking blockchain and NFT. Divine intellect

Connect with your metamask account, download the game **_Duel to earn_**

The point of this game is for players to enjoy the gameplay, posibiliries to earn shjould be always secondary.

## Blockchain

NFTs thru Immutable X, created by Drop DAO and creators. Trade on any exchange, including Drop Marketplace (for Tim: this shit should be eazy af)

All of this shit is on Layer 2 of Ethereum blockchain providing fast and painless way to interact with blockchain. Fast, cheap, easy, secure.

NFTs are ERC-1155, semifungible (think of Pok√©mon Charizard card), could be a part of a collection. Drop DAO NFT standart allows players to import Hyperblade NFTs into other games and vice versa, as well as NFTs having different styling versions (TBA), _what about ability to buy support for your NFT in different game?_

NFTs can have generated variants based on them, like for example a helmet can have color variations, different types of horns and ornaments, how weared they are, all based on the generated signature (0x)

Spacerock $SPR governance token, earned by staking/playing/NFT trade/completing tasks in Hypergraph.

Decentralized game with it's own universe, we aim for the players and creators to become the owners of the platform itself. Tokenholders will be able to participate in voting/creating tasks/get a revenue share

Tokens are released in accordance with the schedule, promoting player-base ownership and decentralization.

In the near future, Drop DAO will be fully self managed as it should be all through Hypergraph.
Hypergraph is Drop's bleeding edge free-for-all project management platform, where tasks are linked in nodes. Earn $SPR by completing tasks (via Drop DAO)
