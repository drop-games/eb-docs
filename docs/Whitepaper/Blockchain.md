# Blockchain & Economy

## Hyperblade DAO

In 2021 it became obvious that the proper way to manage Hyperblade and subsequent projects is through a community driven DAO. The reasoning behind is that majority of the game studios always focuses only on the upcoming projects, where the old ones become only cash-cow and get no proper QOL support.

Other than that, Hyperblade's NFT structure strongly involves both the creators and the actual playerbase. See more in the NFT section

This path relies on: community control over the ecosystem and economy, planned/transparent issuance, free-for-all participation even in creation and development, forks (new projects/mods), project lifecycle not ending with company closing the project (as long as there are people participating, the project will live), meritocracy for creators/developers, player-empowerment, resistance to censorship.

## Space Rock $SPR

Total possible supply: 10,000,000
Phases

Pre-seed 1m $SPR -> 1m USD

Seed -> 2m $SPR -> 5m USD

Team -> 2.5m $SRP

### How to get it

earn or buy

### Yield

Lock money in a contract

### Staking

Stake & incl. timed locking for more reward

Flash pools with affiliates

### Lending

### $SPR as a purchase medium

### Token Economy

graphs and all of that

## Revenue Model

## NFT reasoning

## $SPR Allocation & Vesting

more graphs

## Initial Capital Requirement

while in the closed beta you have to buy your way in to play the game, thus getting early revenue & keeping the playerbase manageable

Later on Free-to-Play

## Voting & ELO token _(yeah Tim, this will be better for HIP)_

Kicks in later with full Hyperblade DAO adoption, playerz only. Populares

Earn this token by playing the game and winning over players, classic ELO scoring system. Easy to understand for players coming from other games. (Winning over better players gives you more $ELO than over lower ranked opponents).

$ELO is always tied to players account/blockchain address.

Players will vote only on gameplay affecting decision (balance, etc), quadratic voting with delegation. Delegate (you can pick your favorite player on the leaderboard),

whoever can propose the change, the change will be added as a task to the DAO system, price will be set like in Gitcoin DAO, and covered by Hyperblade treasury, it should rise if nobody is taking/completing the task. After verifying the completion and validity (should reviewers be staking their $SPR token?) reward will be released from the escrow account.

_Who will be deciding on new content? $SPR or $ELO (i lean towards $SPR) players will dgaf about the cost of the implementation of their desired changes, and it won't be them paying out the bounties/rewards, as it will come out of the treasury-_

Vote and you will roll for an NFT (doesn't matter if delegated or not), you got to open your lootbox or it won't be activated
This roll will be based on your $ELO balance (not the tokens you were given delegation of), this gives top players way to earn even more as they can resell the NFTs

Drop Games will hold 200,000 token initially - frozen account, this will allow Drop Games to participate in the game affecting decision for smoother transition to DAO governance.

Every year there will be more token released and divided between current players (ELO system)

Year 0: 0

Year 1: 100,000

Year 2: 200,000

Year 3: 300,000

Year 4: 400,000

Year 5: 500,000

Year 6: 600,000

And so on

## Regarding Pay-to-Win

Hyperblade will always be accessible and fair to everyone irregards to how much capital they invested in.

# TOKEMAK overview

$TOKE

Liquidity provider deposits $SPR into Tokemak reactor, earn $TOKE. $SPR is deployed by Tokemak to different exchanges in various pairs, mitigating impermanent loss or LP.

$TOKE allows for Tokemak DAO governance and directing liquidity.

Liquidity director (new concept!) is a selected $TOKE holder who will stake their $TOKE to a reactor, getting voting power proportional to their staked $TOKE to direct to what exchanges the liquidity will go to.

The key concept is for LPs and LDs to pursue high APY on their tokens buy putting those tokens in a reactor with low token amount and therefore high APY, low $SPR count in comparison to $TOKE in the reactor means high yields for LPs and vice versa if the $TOKE amount is low compared to $SPR.

Assets are depo

Sometimes external Market Makers are needed to provide real-time asset pricing, these are called Pricers in Tokemak universe.

When you deposit a token to a reactor you get t(token), i.e. tSPR or tTOKE as a receipt of your deposit, use this newly minted token in DeFi ecosystem or burn it when you get your inital assets back.

From the intro
What made us go with the blockchain route is the current situation in the gaming industry where players have basically no control over the game they play, as well as no real in-game asset ownership (items can be permanently removed and banned players lose everything they got). The sole cause of this is a centralized economy that is fully controlled by the developer coming with only one official point of sale and limited/forbidden item & account resale. What this boils to is an economy that has no price-regulation and infinite/unrestricted asset emission, which in turn can lead to an unexpected inflation and items being now worhtless. Those kind of in-game economies are also tied to one particular game (best case, a franchise), so the items are rendered useless outside of it. Finally, the reality that the game can be simply closed down by the developer/IP owner (which happened to still popular multiplayer titles like _Need for Speed: World_ or _Battlefield Heroes_), shows that players are perceived only as a source of income, and barelly something else.

We mitigated the issues listed above by going the blockchain way. Real ownership and true item scarcity are now guaranteed by the smart-contract and blockchain integrity. Item-owners are permitted to do anything with their items, even outside of the game ecosystem. In fact, it is in DAO's interest that the players are trading/gambling/staking/leasing their items, as this generates market fees and therefore revenue. Hyperblade's inherit openness leads to greater adoption with more people flocking to see what is going on, creative individuals coming to expand the universe, and talented developers building interesting third party tools, possibly even forking the game.

Our goal is to make Hyperblade DAO self-sufficient and managed by people who love the project and want it succeed as much as we do. We're whole digital ecosystem that includes an easy fiat on/off-ramp, peer-to-peer marketplace, earning platform, creative suite and more we want to reach to as many people as we can, showing them that gaming can be done differently now.
