# Blockchain & Economy

## Hyperblade DAO

In 2021 it became obvious that the proper way to manage Hyperblade and subsequent projects is through a community driven DAO. The reasoning behind is that majority of the game studios always focuses only on the upcoming projects, where the old ones become only cash-cow and get no proper QOL support.

Other than that, Hyperblade's NFT structure strongly involves both the creators and the actual playerbase. See more in the NFT section
