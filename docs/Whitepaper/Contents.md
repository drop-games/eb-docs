# List of contents

**To be deprecated; this is literally just a list of what should go to each page (+TLDR in intro)**

**Hyperblade is**  
_Intro (cca one paragraph)_

core concept (tiny bit of story); core gameplay; explaning basics (TLDR); why blockchain; one full page cca 3 paragraphs; include some buzzwords; some custom made visuals

you should get understand what this WP is about

**Game**  
_Explanation for someone who WILL play the game_
Story details  
Game setting
Core gameplay mechanics - fighting, controls (mobile friendly), stances, weapon types, character archetypes
Swordplay - Directionality, parries & block, attack types, ragdoll, other stuff
Visual theme (hydrant) (arena locations will go here)
Sword & Character customization (images with different customizations on character model, incl variants  
esports ready and why it's importnant  
list/link roadmap topics

**Blockchain & Tokenomics**  
_HyperBlade DAO basics + principles_  
player ownership -> governance & revenue sharing;  
SPR - what is it -> ingame currency, hardcoded values (total amount of token), how to get it, what to do w it - ingame economy - buying stuff (NFT & other), token economy, LIQIDITY (Tokemak?),  
SPR - mechanics -> play game - earn, (buy on markets), staking - what is the purpose (revenue redist & governance decentralization & rewarding for loyalty & bringing more people), where the funds are coming from - revenue (token buyback by DAO?) & staking pool, staking schedule - mechanics  
revenue model (include burning tokens) - direct selling, market fees, other; tools & platforms for other projects  
allocation & vesting, what will each allocated part go to, HB Treasury purpose  
rounds of raising capital (direct token sale, limited release, steady release, minting?)  
capital required to play (initially); game is not P2W, in the beginning you get bokken kendo wooden sword  
Reasoning NFT (basic)  
Time ore as reward for players (future) - ref to roadmap

**Governance**  
_HB DAO (everything about it)_  
voting; council? (based on 7 quadratically voted in members); issues to vote on; supermajority; specific cases (members leaving, coercion, other); rewards for the service; player's voice & $SRP hodlers voice;

voting for NFTs  
other types of voting

Drop Games role - main developer & de jure owner  
How decentralization will be achieved and what will it give

**NFT**  
_Detailed explanation of NFTs_  
Drop Games NFTs; Community created NFTs; NFT types - Swords, Armor, Other, real estate; NFT Themes & Collections; NFT mutability (contract upgradability)  
How to earn NFT - duel to earn, buy on market  
Temporarily held NFT (like a boxing belt for champs etc)

**Technical part**  
_how the game is built_  
specific aspects typing game to blockchain  
UE5; contracts & audits; L2 solution used; risks; store specific; DAO mechanisms; how to make purchases; or sell stuff; more graphs of token/NFT etc

security; accessibility; censorship resistance; decentralization

**Roadmap**  
_the plan_  
Current situation (might skip), pre-sale tokens ($SPR & NFT); closed-beta (pay-to-play); public release (f2p)

Needs & wants will go here

future/ideas -> game modes & social stuff (dojos?); single player & campaign; more user created stuff like arenas etc; consoles & mobile; necessity to constatly expand the HB Metaverse (more games?)

**Marketing/Community management**  
HyperBlade DAO: it's own website (what will it have), discord, reddit, youtube;  
Marketing: trailers; promo; paid tournaments; nft lottery; collabs with other projects

---

**Cool shit**  
Gambling (token & nft); Self-hosted tourneys; Launcher; Store; third-party services integration; real estate (DOJO) nfts (expand by winning?); play the game for someone else (Knight); quadratic voting; tools for creators (opensource); leaderboard NFT + vote delegation; income tracking board per account (tax purposes), Player voice -> ELO token

**Buzzwords**  
UE5; Free-to-Play; Cross-play & Cross-Platform; Mobile; esports; Blockchain; Ethereum; Level 2; Token; NFT; DAO; open source; divine intellect; stylized

**Experimental**  
deterministic gameplay (blockchain verified); switch from client<->server to client<->blockchain(road to serverless, P2P gaming)

**Maths**  
Token issuance curve ($SPR); token allocation & vesting curves; planned inflation; market fees curve; DAO profit sharing; DAO voting

<!-- Active player curves:

a = [(0,0),(1,1000),(2,2200),(3,2500),(4,3000),(5,4000),(6,3500),(7,3200),(8,4800),(9,6500),(10,7500),(11,7700),(12,7000),(14,6800),(18,26600),(20,30000),(22,32000),(24,28000),(26,26000),(28,40000),(30,20000),(32,15000),(34,11000),(36,12000)]

$$
\left(\frac{-3x^{3/2}}{x^{-1/3}}\right)^{3}
$$

Let $f:[a,b]  to  R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$. Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$. -->

Spacerock $SPR governance token, earned by staking/playing/NFT trade/completing tasks in Hypergraph. Keep your shit staked for set periods of time to earn even more $$$ (or even nfts!), LIST MORE INCENTIVES FOR PRICE TO MOON

Decentralized game with it's own universe, we aim for the players and creators to become the owners of the platform itself. Tokenholders will be able to participate in voting/creating tasks/get a revenue share (coming primary from sales fees/nft creation fees/yield farming/classic revenue stream)

Play to earn (how to get token), which incentivises players to play lol:
duel to earn
scheduled tourneys
participating in stuff like - voting (gov and NFT)
rewards for minting/creating NFT
reimbursing marketplace fees

In the near future, Drop DAO will be fully self managed as it should be all through Hypergraph.
Hypergraph is Drop's bleeding edge free-for-all project management platform, where tasks are linked in nodes. Earn $SPR by completing tasks (via Drop DAO)

Token Allocation & Release schedule:

1. DROP DAO Treasury
2. DROP Games (Drop corporation)
3. Market Sale (whether private/public)
4. Some mfers (advisors?)

Drop DAO allocates $SPR for:

1. Internal HB Economy
2. Token economy

x. Third party incentives (voted in by DAO)

**Voting:** \
Initally it's Drop Games calling all the shots, later the community will take the rule through the DAO

HOWEVER - it's actual players who should be guiding where the game goes gameplay-wise, since it's them who play the game
Voting on NFTs can involve $SPR holders

Quadratic voting with delegation is the preferred way of voting

**ELO Token:** \
Proposed idea: player-participation token - think ELO score, when players play the game they earn the token -> finishing matches, winning over better opponents in ranked, leaderboard with the list of players rated by ELO token. fixed rate hyperinflation (tokens earned this year will have half the voting power compared to the amount of tokens you'd earn by playing/winning the same amount of matches the next year) you can vote (quadratically) with this token, this leads to active players being able to participate in game-balance affecting decisions. Token is non-transferable (you can't sell it), but you can delegate your token to players you choose (i.e. select the player on the leaderboard with the same playstyle and give him your voting power).

## Roadmap

Well do tons of good shit over the time

##

Enter the game

At first (semi-closed game), there should be some capital reuquirement to play the game, which should be eventually lowered or abolished (after all we want to have a game thats accessible for all) -->

<!-- Duel to Earn
Community owned, DAO governance, players are involved in governance and receive a share from the earnings (they duel to earn, then stake their tokens)
Hyperblade = Blade Symphony with NFTs

Game First. Everything else is built as an infrastructure around it. Game must be fun to play. Game must be playable and accessible.

You fight opponenets with swords and earn monies that you can spend on NFTs n shit, players own their NFTS and are able to do anything with em.

This is a cool game because its on Unreal 5 and its free-to-play and will be opensource with fucking blockchain and NFT.

Connect with your metamask account, download the game **_Duel to earn_**

The point of this game is for players to enjoy the gameplay, posibilities to earn are just as important for the sake of us getting rich. -->
