# List of contents

**To be deprecated; this is literally just a list of what should go to each page (+TLDR in intro)**

**Hyperblade is**  
_Intro (~one paragraph)_

core concept (tiny bit of story); core gameplay; explaning basics (TLDR); why blockchain; one full page cca 3 paragraphs; include some buzzwords; some custom made visuals

you should get understand what this WP is about

write this the last

**Game**  
_Explanation for someone who WILL play the game_
Story details  
Core gameplay mechanics - fighting, controls (mobile friendly), stances, weapon types, character archetypes
Swordplay - Directionality, parries & block, attack types, ragdoll, other stuff
Game setting
Visual theme (hydrant) (arena locations will go here)
Sword & Character customization (images with different customizations on character model, incl variants  
esports ready and why it's importnant  
list/link roadmap topics

**Blockchain & Tokenomics**  
_HyperBlade DAO basics + principles_  
player ownership -> governance & revenue sharing;  
SPR - what is it -> ingame currency, hardcoded values (total amount of token), how to get it, what to do w it - ingame economy - buying stuff (NFT & other), token economy, LIQIDITY (Tokemak?),  
SPR - mechanics -> play game - earn, (buy on markets), staking - what is the purpose (revenue redist & governance decentralization & rewarding for loyalty & bringing more people), where the funds are coming from - revenue (token buyback by DAO?) & staking pool, staking schedule - mechanics  
revenue model (include burning tokens) - direct selling, market fees, other; tools & platforms for other projects  
allocation & vesting, what will each allocated part go to, HB Treasury purpose  
rounds of raising capital (direct token sale, limited release, steady release, minting?)  
capital required to play (initially); game is not P2W, in the beginning you get bokken kendo wooden sword  
Reasoning NFT (basic)  
Time ore as reward for players (future) - ref to roadmap

**Governance**  
_HB DAO (everything about it)_  
voting; council? (based on 7 quadratically voted in members); issues to vote on; supermajority; specific cases (members leaving, coercion, other); rewards for the service; player's voice & $SRP hodlers voice;

voting for NFTs  
other types of voting

Drop Games role - main developer & de jure owner  
How decentralization will be achieved and what will it give

**NFT**  
_Detailed explanation of NFTs_  
Drop Games NFTs; Community created NFTs; NFT types - Swords, Armor, Other, real estate; NFT Themes & Collections; NFT mutability (contract upgradability)  
How to earn NFT - duel to earn, buy on market  
Temporarily held NFT (like a boxing belt for champs etc)

**Technical part**  
_how the game is built_  
specific aspects typing game to blockchain  
UE5; contracts & audits; L2 solution used; risks; store specific; DAO mechanisms; how to make purchases; or sell stuff; more graphs of token/NFT etc

security; accessibility; censorship resistance; decentralization

**Roadmap**  
_the plan_  
Current situation (might skip), pre-sale tokens ($SPR & NFT); closed-beta (pay-to-play); public release (f2p)

Needs & wants will go here

future/ideas -> game modes & social stuff (dojos?); single player & campaign; more user created stuff like arenas etc; consoles & mobile; necessity to constatly expand the HB Metaverse (more games?)

**Marketing/Community management**  
HyperBlade DAO: it's own website (what will it have), discord, reddit, youtube;  
Marketing: trailers; promo; paid tournaments; nft lottery; collabs with other projects

---

**Cool shit**  
Gambling (token & nft); Self-hosted tourneys; Launcher; Store; third-party services integration; real estate (DOJO) nfts (expand by winning?); play the game for someone else (Knight); quadratic voting; tools for creators (opensource); leaderboard NFT + vote delegation; income tracking board per account (tax purposes), Player voice -> ELO token

**Buzzwords**  
UE5; Free-to-Play; Cross-play & Cross-Platform; Mobile; esports; Blockchain; Ethereum; Level 2; Token; NFT; DAO; open source; divine intellect; stylized

**Experimental**  
deterministic gameplay (blockchain verified); switch from client<->server to client<->blockchain(road to serverless, P2P gaming)

**Maths**  
Token issuance curve ($SPR); token allocation & vesting curves; planned inflation; market fees curve; DAO profit sharing; DAO voting

<!-- Active player curves:

a = [(0,0),(1,1000),(2,2200),(3,2500),(4,3000),(5,4000),(6,3500),(7,3200),(8,4800),(9,6500),(10,7500),(11,7700),(12,7000),(14,6800),(18,26600),(20,30000),(22,32000),(24,28000),(26,26000),(28,40000),(30,20000),(32,15000),(34,11000),(36,12000)]

Let $f:[a,b]  to  R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$. Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$. -->
