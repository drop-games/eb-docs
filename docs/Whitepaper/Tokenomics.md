Hyperblade is the first project of Drop Games/Drop DAO

Drop Games Inc., was founded in August 2019 in New York by **Tim** & **Theo**.

In 2021 it became obvious that the proper way to manage Hyperblade and subsequent projects is through a community driven DAO. The reasoning behind is that majority of the game studios always focuses only on the upcoming projects, where the old ones become only cash-cow and get no proper QOL support.

Other than that, Hyperblade's NFT structure strongly involves both the creators and the actual playerbase. See more in the NFT section
