<!-- HB TODO (unordered):

HB DAO:

Game:
Finish the switch to UE5
Redo art in new unified style (hydrant)
New Player models -> customization (NFT)
Universal NFTs = swords, UI, more bullshit
Arenas
Trailers, promo material
Polish!
Consoles - PS5 & XS - possibly with NFTs
Mobile support - possibly with NFTs
Single player/MMO
More gamemodes

Blockchain:
Write & Verify new smart contracts
Wallet integration (mb our own wallet?)
Figure out tokenomics -> liquidity, staking, player-rewards
DROP DAO, allocation of token, treasury, vesting schedules
Player empowerments thru the DAO
NFT Store
NFT creating platform
Gambling

Websites -
HB DAO
Snapshot
Whitepaper HB

Part of HB DAO website:
Staking/Liquidity/Providing/Other token related stuff
$SPR tracking (include token allocation)

DROP DAO

Ideas pool:
DETERMINISTIC

2D Fighting game:
One of the principles that we are going with is constant expansion of the usability of the HB assets thus increasing their utility and intristic value. NFTs that were originally minted only for Hyperblade, could (and should!) be used outside of the HB in other games, possibly even outside of the HB universe. Also the same goes the other way around, third-party NFTs could be integrated in HB universe as well, inspiring the other projects to do the same, moving the whole blockchain space even further.

Hyperblade is the original game of the Hyperblade DAO, and as the primary focus the whole HB ecosystem is revolving around Hyperblade the game. This means that NFTs will be tailored for the needs of the project, including release schedule, scope and stylization. So based on the fact that the main NFT types are swords and character customization and that the game is a 3D fighter game, HB DAO can divert some of it's focus on a smaller scale game utilizing the same types of assets.

The most obvious concept would be a 2D platformer fighting game in the like of Super Smash Bros or Brawlstars.

The biggest constant for this type of game would be the use of the same NFTs which HB utilizes; however due to the nature of blockchain and it's immutability, original NFTs could be _expanded_ (as in contract could be upgraded) with other type of visuals. Alternatively the new game could process the visuals itself, where the base model in a particular NFT stay the same, but the game would show it differently.

Alternate NFT visuals could be done either by a pre-written script or manually. Either way has it's downsides and trade-offs.

Example case would be a mobile friendly 2D fighting game with stylized pixelated graphics and gameplay different to HB (closer to classic 2D platformer fighters like SSB/Brawlstars) that uses HB NFTs which models were converted to 2D graphics and given old-school pixel stylization.

HB DAO can allocate some of it's treasury for in-game rewards.

All of this would achieve increased utility for HB NFTs, expanding market for said NFTs and providing much needed marketing and income source for the DAO. -->
