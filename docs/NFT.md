## Why NFTs?

NFTs are changing gaming world as we know it. Players are for the first time the real owners of their items, and are free to do whatever with them.

Hyperblade is built with this in mind. We took the concept of player ownership and integrated in directly in our game.
NFTs are now what makes Hyperblade a unique experience for each and every player.
And it will be one of the first games that features regular and 3D NFTs, both usable in the game. Those items range from basic vanity such as a frame around an avatar, to one-of custom made Dojos. Buy the item you like on the Hyperblade Marketplace or play the game and earn the thing with your own effort. 


## NFTs in Hyperblade



To accomodate the broad spectrum of utility that different types of items have, they follow both fungible (ERC-721) and semifungible (ERC-1155) token specifications[^1]. Token are pre-minted on Layer 1 Ethereum then transfered to Layer 2, and this is where all the activity is going on.

[^1]: non-fungible token and semi-fungible token are techically not the same, but for the sake of simplicity both are referred to as "NFT".


First NFTs in Hyperblade are designed by the core dev team, those will set the standard how the NFTs should look and play like. Our NFTs will be scarce and rare.
Singleplayer is also where player will see _their own_ NFTs. During the playthrough, certain leveled items will be substituted with actual NFTs. Player will dive even deeper in the game atmosphere if they could defeat the final boss with their own sword.

### Lootboxes & Item Rarity
Earning NFTs in the game comes in two flavors, through opening _fair_ lootboxes, or getting the NFT outright. Items and lootboxes come in different rarity tiers, and each lootbox is guaranteed to have at least one item of appropriate rarity level. To open a lootbox, players to use the ingame currency.

We have 7 rarity tiers planned. asdasd

Getting a NFT/lootbox


Permanent NFTs, cwrtain nfts can be tied (welded!) to other NFT by burning it, think you can buy lighting aura for your sword (it could be multipe types of items) and then permanently attach them to that NFT. This can essentially change the aimed NFT, accessory can be removed using a 'plain NFT'?. Modified NFTs aim to have a different price building structure.:wa:




We strive for the best player experience, and this means absence of Pay-to-Win mechanics. None of the NFTs/items are balance affecting. You cannot buy skill in Hyperblade.
### Community Designed NFTs

Creators design NFTs, community votes for them using $SPR. If the item is voted in, then it becomes available on the NFT marketplace and creator gets cut from the sale (and subsequent resales) of this item.



Tim's idea: you vote for something and you get share from the sales. Voters should be insentivized to choose good shit, and not just anything for the sake of it. Balance between quantity of this sNFT and quality


### NFT Collections & Themes

Items are often for the sake of consistency pooled together in a collection, which is a series of itmes that share common style/properties. It is possible for one item to be a part of multiple collections. Sell the whole collection to get more profit? (remember in Morrowind when you were missing just one cauldron from the whole set?)

### NFT Marketplace

Unwrapped Hyperblade NFTs will be available both on third party market placeces such as Rarible, OpenSea and such, as well as the Hyperblade Marketplace

HB NFTs are always playable in the game, but also viewable outside of the game, with our push for total decentralization NFTs will be stored (stored as in, not just hash/metadata, but the model and such) on decentralized platforms such as IPFS.

## NFT Types

There are various types of NFT availible inside and outside of the game

### Swords

Start with a basic wooden sword, then mutate it (to katana, tanto, hammer etc), sometimes u get a rarish wooden sword (like with blue flames or some shit)
Obtain full swords from the market, or rare drops (match win), win them from other players or pools
Breedable (not in the retarded Cryptokitties way lmao)! Spend guap to breed them, or buy/earn them outright. All of that (de)generative art is like gen1 of the whole shit, tbh I don't think adding new features should be that problem even retroactively
Use on any character, have different randomly generated characteristics features etc (CSGO)
Collectible shit
Different combos/animations needed -> swords vs hammers. i.e Drop DAO would create tasks for new shit and then it becomes an option to select this type on sword creation.
Melt swords? (burning the NFT)
Each sword has history (wins n shit)

### Armor & Character Accessories

Player model like in Morrowind (dress it up)
Character specific
Sets, create your own sets, sell as a collection
Non-fungible and semi fungible (1 of 8 etc), pre-configured
Couldd be only visual/vanity (doesn't have to be gameplay affecting)

### Other

Shit like banners, UI, essentially useless vanity shit that should tell everybody how cool you are

Animations & Emotes

Custom Map skins as NFT

### Dojo

NFT real estate, very limited, decorate with HB NFTs (Armory & Sword collection), as well as with your own non-HB NFTs - jpeg paintings etc., these can be lent to/from other people. Expand by paying hefty $$ or winning games. Invite other people to visit, if the space allows you can bring in other people to visit
