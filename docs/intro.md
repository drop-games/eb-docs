## Welcome to Hyperblade

**Hyperblade** is the first game that is connecting real gamers and the world of blockchain.

The development started in 2019 as the _'Project Blade,'_ and from Day 1 our goal was to create a game with a super low entry barrier, amazing replayablity and competitive edge. Blockchain brought a big twist on how the game is being made, as well as the fact that players can now be empowered to have a say and stake in the game they play. As of today (September 2021) the game is in it's alpha stage with full release scheduled for 2022.

## Core concept

_
**Hyperblade** is a competitive free-to-play sword fighting game, as well as a way for players to get real life income by playing the game they like.
_

But we are not developing only a game, Hyperblade is a whole new ecosystem built around the idea that players are much more than just a source of revenue. We took a brand new approach of putting together decentralization and openness of blockchain with a game that is actually fun to play. The organization behind the project is Hyperblade DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. This is a new type of entity that puts the community in the forefront, _creating incentives and a sound framework for thousands of people to organize without the need for formal roles or hiearchy_[^1].

The backbone of **Hyperblade DAO** (and therefore the Hyperblade ecosystem) is **Spacerock** **($SPR)** ERC-20 token. The DAO governance and revenues are all equally shared between the $SPR tokenholders.

## The Game

**Hyperblade** is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines our world with the world of sci-fi. The result is an original and compelling narrative revolving around martial arts and melee weapons. We want players to be fans not only of the game, but of the whole Hyperblade universe itself.

A group of erudites called _‘The Architects’_ has been pushing the progress of the human race for centuries. Now in the distant future, human race is at that point where their technology is basically magic-like. The culmination of Architects' efforts was them synthesizing a new universe in a quantum experiment. After analyzing all of the data, they determine that the universe they created is the polar opposite to their own universe. In shock, they realize that this negative universe is a vessel for them to be in while they got to create their own original universe. This means that in the physics world of Hyperblade, existence and time are in a loop. One universe creates the other, forming a chain dependency.

Architects move to the negative universe and establish there an idealized interplanetary society. Ancient philosophy, honor and martial arts are now an essential part of this space-faring civilization. The storyline is following a teenager from current day New York who was by throwed to this world by the forces unknown to him. He is discovering his power and abilities for melee combat in a quest of figuring out what is his role in this society and how he can get back home.

The game itself is a third-person fighter where players are dueling each other using various melee weapons ranging from katana swords to warhammers and halberds . The dynamics of the game can be compared to the likes of _Tekken_, _Mortal Kombat_ or _Super Smash Bros_. The simple control scheme makes Hyperblade accessible even for casual gamers. And at the same time, inputs being sharp and precise is what is making the game esports ready. Skill and knowledge of the game is how a player gets an edge over his opponents, pay-to-win is not applicable here.

## Blockchain

True blockchain gaming is the product of _Free-to-Play/Item Ownership/User driven developement_ trends in gamedev and _Decentralization/Permisionlessness/Determinism_ principles of the blockchain.

We want to change the belief that blockchain gaming is only about having NFTs and a tokenized currency. The value of blockchain gaming is in the ecosystem being fair to it's users who are now able to direct what direction their project is actually going.

**Hyperblade DAO** is the organization of **Spacerock token-holders**. Those are: players themselves, developers, various creatives, and people who just care about the success of the DAO (or the token). The initial governance is shared between core developers and seven voted-in councilmembers. This is not the final look of the DAO, the power will continue to shift to the most talented and highly driven community members. This time, it is the community that creates the product, and not the other way around.

The cornerstone of Hyperblade's complex economy is **Spacerock ($SPR)** token, issued and managed by Hyperblade DAO. Players earn Spacerock by directly playing the game, trading on the marketplace, or staking the token in a pool (and providing liquidity to the token, making it valuable outside of the HB ecosystem). The token serves two purposes: DAO voting and as a financial insturment. Token holders receive a share of revenues generated from the token usage as well as what they earn by staking. Revenue is coming from sales on Hyperblade marketplace (NFT & DLC), fees from NFT resales, and more.

**NFTs** were one of the main driving forces behind crypto this year (2021), bringing in enourmous revenues and drawing the best artistic talent. By changing the core concept of digital asset ownership, NFTs managed to show the mainstream what blockchain is truly about. Creatives gained a powerful outlet for their artistry as well as direct access to the profits this generates. For us, NFTs is how artists can participate in the making of Hyperblade by putting their creations in the game directly. Artists first submit their items for a community vote, then DAO approves and sends the best ones to the market. Now that creatives get a fair share from sale of their items, Hyperblade gets virtual museum quality NFTs that are actually usable in game. And usable means not only visible as vanity collectible cards, but items that players equip to battle their foes. _Start with a basic wooden Bokken and rise to the top with something like a Dark-matter Skimitar of Eternal Terror with the amount of 'slays' engraved on the blade._

One big issue that we're focusing on is accessibility, so besides the game being free-to-play, all blockchain activity is on L2. This means that the cost of dealing with NFTs is democratic and and not restrictive at all.

## Whitepaper

The whitepaper goes deeper on the topics from this introduction. It summarizes the mechanics and principles of Hyperblade and the DAO. Reader should get an understanding of the project and how it's being made.
