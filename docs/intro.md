## Abstract

<p className="abstract">
<b>Hyperblade</b> is an economic experiment in a value redistribution that combines a decentralized blockchain gaming ecosystem and an earning platform.
It's unique proposition is in the fusion of a highly replayable and accessible fighter game with elements of blockchain, particularly play-to-earn and on-chain governance & asset ownership.
Hyperblade itself is a tactical melee-fighting game with cross-play on PC/Consoles/Mobile, prioritizing mathematical logic for the balance and giving players mainstream-ready gameplay and user experience.
Combining the lessons learned from both gaming and blockchain industries, Hyperblade augments the now common free-to-play with play-to-earn cryptocurrency rewards in a fair distribution system dubbed "Duel-to-Earn", along with seamless blockchain integration via monetary and governance token "Spacerock", allowing the community to both govern and earn in a decentralized way.
The inherent transparency, trustlessness and permissionless are further projected by tying game assets to Web3 wallet ownership, leveraging the openness of the platform to be the basis of the following gaming and infrastructure projects.
Our goal is to shift the paradigms of the value creation, proving that community-driven approach is a sustainable way of developing highly artistic and innovative projects.

## Industry Dynamics

The world as we know it is going through changes. Since the inception of the internet and it's broad adoption along with mobile technologies we've been facing an unprecedented level of innovation, changing the way we work, communicate and enjoy entertainment.

## The Game

**Hyperblade** is an online third-person fighter revolving around player-vs-player combat using various melee weapons ranging from katanas and longswords to warhammers and spears.
The premise of the game is competitive nature of the fighter genre,
where the dynamics can be compared to the likes of _Tekken_, _Mortal Kombat_ or _Super Smash Bros_,
and the community-first approach, where the the value is being build in and out of the game.
The high replayability is achieved by combining the super flexible combat and fair matchmaking with rich customization of play-style and appereance, making every duel not like any another.

What distinguishes Hyperblade as a fighter game from it's predecessors is the native support for **cross-play**. PC, console and mobile players can all duel against each other on equal ground, as the mechanics of the game give no explicit advantage to either platform, thus enabling for real cross-play with no compromises.
The simple control scheme Hyperblade accessible even for casual gamers, yet at the same time, sharp and precise inputs allow for competitive ranked gameplay and the eventual emergence of esports.
In Hyperblade, skill and knowledge of the game is how a player gets an edge over his opponents, pay-to-win is not applicable here as purchasable items have no effect on the game balance.

The game itself is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines our world with the world of sci-fi, presented through a series of lore building singleplayer campaigns. The result is an original and compelling narrative revolving around martial arts and melee weapons.

Our goal is to make players fans not only of the game, but of the whole Hyperblade universe.

## Blockchain

Hyperblade is a part of Ethereum ecosystem and utilizes blockchain for governance, in-game economy and item ownership. The cornerstone of Hyperblade's complex economy are **Spacerock** and **Timeore** ERC-20 tokens. Most of the user-facing blockchain activity is conducted on Layer 2 of Ethereum, providing users with secure, fast and cheap access to the platform.

Hyperblade is developed by **[Hyperblade DAO](Governance)**, a decentralized organization of **Spacerock token-holders** who participate in governance via on-chain quadratic voting.
Initially, the direct governance is shared between core developers and seven voted-in council members, who in turn vote openly on pending proposals submitted by the community.

The proposition behind Hyperblade DAO is to put the community in the forefront by creating incentives and a collaboration framework for thousands of people without the need of a formal roles or hierarchy, empowering the most talented and highly driven community members.
With the accessibility and best player experience in mind, _Hyperblade has to be an inherently democratic and fair platform_. Free-to-play online distribution of the game, decentralized governance & ownership and nominal cost for blockchain interaction are key for equity of all of the participants.

**[Spacerock ($SPR)](Blockchain)** serves as the primary monetary and governance token of Hyperblade, is the basis for DAO revenue redistribution, and has a fixed supply of **10,000,000 $SPR** released in a transparent and controlled manner.
The revenue is coming from sales on **Hyperblade Marketplace** (NFT & DLC), fees from NFT resales, and through other DAO initiatives.
$SPR further allows for advanced DeFi functionality, including DAO arranged **Staking** and **Liquidity Providing** allowing holders to earn passive income in form of additional $SPR and bonus reward NFTs.

**[Timeore ($TMO)](Blockchain#timeore)** is a Play-to-Earn reward token, received by players for their time and effort contributing to the Hyperblade economy via playing the game, and therefore providing online activity and competitiveness. As an important component inspiring participation, Hyperblade DAO takes a sustainable approach of fairly and accurately rewarding an unbounded amount of players with **NFT Loot Crates** and Timerock, that is in turn burned to open Loot Crates.

## NFT

**NFTs** allow for unrestricted and uncensorable in-game item ownership, with the uniqueness and scarcity guaranteed by the integrity of the blockchain.

Together with Spacerock and Timeore, [NFTs](NFT) are the core of the decentralized asset ownership in Hyperblade. Tied to **Web3 wallets**, Hyperblade items are in the full custody of their respective owners.

Obtained either through opening [Loot Crates](NFT#loot-crates--item-rarity), on Hyperblade Marketplace, or through air drops, [NFTs are utilized](NFT#nft-types) directly in-game in form of swords, and armor and minor cosmetics, allowing for rich and exhaustive customization/personalization.
Items come in 7 rarity tiers, and have increasing level of uniqueness and features, implying higher valuation.
Functionality is the essential attribute of Hyperblade NFTs, items might be modified or accessorized.
Furthermore the player's ability to augment the owned sword as they progress through the game is one of the cornerstones of making the game a unique experience for each game.

_Start with a basic wooden Bokken and rise to the top wielding Dark-matter Skimitar of Eternal Terror with the amount of 'slays' engraved on the blade._

But the crucial distinction of Hyperblade NFTs is their utility _outside_ of the game.
Aside from being available in the **[Hyperblade NFT Viewer App](NFT#hyperblade-nft-viewer-app)**, items are exposed to the broad blockchain ecosystem.
On-chain activities like _lending, fractionalizing, wagering etc._ are not only permitted, but rather promoted.
With the metadata being freely accessible, items can be used in other games as well, not limited by Hyperblade and its universe, further expanding their real value.

The underlying artistic side of NFTs allow them to be a ground creative expression of the community. Artist submit their created NFT art, for instance sword or character skins, to a community vote, and the pieces that passed are then included in game. Creatives then get a fair share from the profits from the NFTs they created, as well as Hyperblade gets more museum quality pieces directly available for use in the game.

## Background

The development of Hyperblade started in 2019 then as the _'Project Blade,'_ by Drop Games Inc., a company founded by **Tim & Theo Born**. From Day 1 the goal was to create a game with a super low entry barrier, amazing replayablity and competitive edge. Blockchain brought a big twist on how the game is being made, as well as the fact that players can now be empowered to have a say and stake in the game they play. As of today (October 2021) the game is in its alpha stage with full release scheduled for 2022.
