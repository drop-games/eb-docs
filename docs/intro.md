## Abstract

<p className="abstract">
<b>Hyperblade</b> is an economic experiment in the value redistribution of creative labor. 
It's unique value proposition is the fusion of a highly accessible, yet competitive fighting game and with a lore rich enterntainment universe with an exploration of novel economic paradigms that enable new market price discovery mechanisms aimed at ethically and equitably redistributing the unique quantized value that each individual of a community contributes.
Combining the lessons learned from both gaming and blockchain industries, Hyperblade augments the now common free-to-play with play-to-earn cryptocurrency rewards in a fair distribution system dubbed "Duel-to-Earn", along with seamless blockchain integration via monetary and governance token "Spacerock", allowing the community to both govern and earn in a decentralized way.
The inherent transparency, trustlessness and permissionless are further projected by tying game assets to Web3 wallet ownership, leveraging the openness of the platform to be the basis of the following gaming and infrastructure projects.
Our goal is to shift the paradigms of the value creation, proving that community-driven approach is a sustainable way of developing highly artistic and innovative projects.

## Creative Labor

Since the inception of the internet and it's broad adoption alongside mobile technologies we've been facing an unprecedented level of innovation, changing the way we work, communicate and enjoy entertainment. And _blockchain_ with it's radical value proposition is shaping up to be the breakthrough that changes the way we live yet again.

Blockchain's decentralized ownership and governance results in fair and equal treatment of all, guaranteed by the integrity of blockchain and the smart contracts.
The virtual asset ownership in form of tokens allows the creatives to be fully recognized and appreciated. The **2021 NFT & blockchain gaming boom** is a prime example of how community can empower the authors, setting the stage for a new wave of innovation starting now.

Despite the current simplicity of blockchain games, play-to-earn and NFTs are attracting millions of players, making an enormous impact on the whole market and signifying the potential of blockchain integrated gaming. Gaming world is ready for blockchain and the unrestricted innovation and uncensorable ownership that it comes with, connecting entertainment with the latest technology once again.

[Appendix](Appendix) section features an elaborate analysis of blockchain gaming and it's history, as well as the role of innovation in the video gaming industry.

## The Game

**Hyperblade** is an online third-person fighter revolving around player-vs-player combat using various melee weapons ranging from katanas and longswords to warhammers and spears.
The premise of the game is competitive nature of the fighter genre,
where the dynamics can be compared to the likes of _Tekken_, _Mortal Kombat_ or _Super Smash Bros_,
and the community-first approach, building the value in and out of the game.
The high replayability is achieved by combining the super flexible combat and fair matchmaking with rich play-style/appearance customization, making every duel not like any another.

What distinguishes Hyperblade as a fighter game from it's predecessors is the native support for **cross-play**. PC, console and mobile players can all duel against each other on equal grounds, as the mechanics of the game give no explicit advantage to either platform thus enabling for real cross-play with no compromises.
The simple control scheme makes Hyperblade accessible even for casual gamers, yet at the same time sharp and precise inputs allow for competitive ranked gameplay and the eventual emergence of esports.
In Hyperblade, skill and knowledge of the game is how a player gets an edge over his opponents, Pay-to-Win is not applicable here as purchasable items have no effect on the game balance.

The game itself is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines real world with the world of sci-fi, presented through a series of lore building singleplayer campaigns. The result is an original and compelling narrative revolving around martial arts and melee weapons.

## Blockchain

Hyperblade is a part of _Ethereum_ ecosystem and utilizes blockchain for governance, in-game economy and item ownership. The cornerstone of Hyperblade's complex economy are **Spacerock** and **Timeore** ERC-20 tokens. Most of the user-facing blockchain activity is conducted on _Layer 2_ of Ethereum, providing users with secure, fast and cheap access to the platform.

Hyperblade is developed by **[Hyperblade DAO](Governance)**, a decentralized organization of **Spacerock token-holders** who participate in governance via on-chain quadratic voting.
Initially, the direct governance is shared between core developers and seven voted-in council members, who in turn vote openly on pending proposals submitted by the community.

The proposition behind Hyperblade DAO is to give the community a platform to participate in the development on an even basis with the core team, which is done by by creating incentives and a collaboration framework without formal roles or hierarchy.
The end-goal is to empower the most talented and highly driven community members, where the DAO evolves into a something bigger than a gaming platform.

With the accessibility and the best gaming experience in mind, _Hyperblade has to be a fundamentally egalitarian platform_. Free-to-play distribution, decentralized governance/ownership and unrestrictive blockchain interactivity are the key for equity of all of the participants.

**[Spacerock ($SPR)](Blockchain)** serves as the primary monetary and governance token of Hyperblade, is the basis for DAO revenue redistribution, and has a fixed supply of **10,000,000 $SPR** released in a transparent and controlled manner.
The revenue is coming from sales on **Hyperblade Marketplace** (NFT & DLC), fees from peer-to-peer commerce, and other DAO initiatives.
$SPR further allows for advanced DeFi functionality, including DAO arranged **Staking** and **Liquidity Providing** that allows $SPR holders to earn passive income in form of additional $SPR and NFT rewards.

**[Timeore ($TMO)](Blockchain#timeore)** is a Play-to-Earn reward token, received by players for their time and effort contributing to the Hyperblade economy by playing the game and therefore providing online activity and competitiveness.
With rewards being undoubtly an important component inspiring participation,
Hyperblade DAO has to take a sustainable approach of fairly and accurately distributing **NFT Loot Crates** and Timerock (used to open the Crates) among an unbounded amount of players.

## NFT

**NFTs** allow for truly unrestricted and uncensorable in-game item ownership, with the uniqueness and scarcity guaranteed by the integrity of the blockchain.

Together with Spacerock and Timeore, [NFTs](NFT) are the core of the decentralized asset ownership in Hyperblade. Tied to **Web3 wallets**, Hyperblade items are in the full custody of their respective owners.

Obtained either by opening [Loot Crates](NFT#loot-crates--item-rarity), on Hyperblade Marketplace, or through air drops, [NFTs are utilized](NFT#nft-types) directly in-game in form of swords, and armor and minor cosmetics, allowing for rich and exhaustive customization/personalization.
Items come in 7 rarity tiers with an increasing level of uniqueness and features, implying higher valuations of top tier items compared to the common ones.
Utility is the quintessential attribute of Hyperblade NFTs, items carry functionality directly in the game itself including ways to modify or customize.
Furthermore the player's ability to augment their sword as they progress through the game and then use it in multiplayer is one of the ways playing Hyperblade is a unique experience for each and every player.

_Start with a basic wooden Bokken and rise to the top wielding Dark-matter Skimitar of Eternal Terror with the amount of 'slays' engraved on the blade._

But the crucial distinctive trait of Hyperblade NFTs is their utility _outside_ of the game.
Other than being available in the **[Hyperblade NFT Viewer App](NFT#hyperblade-nft-viewer-app)**, items are integrated with the greater blockchain ecosystem.
On-chain activities like _lending, fractionalizing, wagering etc._ are not only permitted, but rather encouraged, as that essentially increases the intristic values of the items.
With the metadata being openly accessible, HB NFTs might be used in other projects as well, including other games, collections or even basis for new

The underlying artistic side of the NFTs allow them to be a ground creative expression of the community. Artists submit their created NFT art, for instance a sword or character skin, to a community vote, and the pieces that passed are then included in game. Creatives then get a fair share from the profits from the NFTs they created, and Hyperblade gets museum quality pieces directly available in the game.

## Open Sourcing

The openness and unrestricted innovation, along with security and reliability, made crypto space what it is now.
Open sourcing and the free flow of ideas, that are essential to blockchain, allowed even small teams to build monumental projects that would be imposible to make without the ability to stand on the shoulders of giants.

Hyperblade as a blockchain native project shares the same values.
The planned functionality requires an extensive amount of engineering, where the technology is being developed using the available open source code and through the collaboration with other teams, e.g. using open source _Uniswap V2_ to build a decentralized Hyperblade exchange. DAO acknowledges that it in the common interest to share the innovation even further, and therefore all of the code will be made available in open, combining GPL licensing for common components such as Marketplace, DEX or governance modules, and delayed open-sourcing via BSL for Hyperblade's art side with 3 year closed-source period.

## Background

The development of Hyperblade started in 2019 then as the _'Project Blade,'_ by Drop Games Inc., a company founded by **Tim & Theo Born**. From Day 1 the goal was to create a game with a super low entry barrier, amazing replayablity and competitive edge. Blockchain brought a big twist on how the game is being made, as well as the fact that players can now be empowered to have a say and stake in the game they play. As of today (October 2021) the game is in its alpha stage with full release scheduled for 2022.
