## Abstract

**Hyperblade** is a decentralized blockchain gaming ecosystem and earning platform.

Hyperblade,
UE5; Free-to-Play; Cross-play & Cross-Platform; Mobile; esports; play-to-earn (sustainable); Blockchain; Ethereum; Level 2; crypto wallet; Token; NFT; DAO; dApp; open source; divine intellect; stylized
an economic experiment in value redistribution

But we are not developing only a game, Hyperblade is a whole new ecosystem built around the idea that players are much more than just a source of revenue. We took a brand new approach of putting together decentralization and openness of blockchain with a game that is actually fun to play. The organization behind the project is Hyperblade DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. This is a new type of entity that puts the community in the forefront, _creating incentives and a sound framework for thousands of people to organize without the need for formal roles or hiearchy_[^1].

## Industry Dynamics

Entertainment as we know it today would not be the same without _video games_.
Starting as a niche pasttime associated with children and enthusiasts, video gaming turned into a cultural phenomenon appreciated by billions of people and rivaling such entertainment behemoths like movie or music industries[^1][^2].
What makes video gaming this kind of a dominant force is it's unique position where it encompasses entertainment, creativity and innovation.
In 50 years we went simplistic games like _Pong_, which featured two paddles bouncing a ball and a scoreboard, to pieces that are redefining the meaning of _simulation_ with graphics and gameplay rivaling those of real life.

### The Role of Innovation

One of the primary reasons video game industry had such an skyrocketing growth, is it's inherent reliance on innovation up to the point where digital games are often regarded as an industry where technological advancements first get concretized[^7].
By virtue of connecting users directly with the latest technologies, game development in is position to be the vanguard of tech innovation. Notably, the practical usage of AI in the games and interactive 3D environments, essentially allows creation of brand new, live, virtual worlds and universes.

With development tools like game engines (Unity and Unreal Engine) and distribution systems (AppStore/Google Play/Steam/etc.) being in high maturity, games can be now developed relatively efficiently in a streamlined manner. This combined with all time high accessibility and technology penetration of gaming, allow both AAA and indie gaming to strive side-by-side, challenging each other in a fight for player's hearts and wallets. The significance of innovation in this race is evident by the way separate technologies change the reality of the gaming market.

The two key, rather convienience, innovations that have shaped (and dominated) the market in the past decade were _mobile_ and _free-to-play_ gaming, often combined. More than half of the players and revenues come from mobile devices, where the accessibility and portability allow one to play irregardless of where they are.
The possibility to play the game for free and only pay when one wants to, thus adding to the overall convienience, was another factor changing the face of the industry with F2P now bringing 78% of the gaming digital revenues[^2].

The consumer's ability to adapt and strive in a rapidly changing technological environment should allow developers to experiment with the core values of the products they make, yet developers still tend to be conservative and disregard the possible "first mover" advantages of the emerging technologies[^3]. The omnipresent centralization and nontransparency often stifles creativity and innovation, and furthermore, the top-down hierarchial structures, coupled with pure for-profit intentions lead to market inefficiencies and players often disappointed with the games they are offered. There is a need for change in the core values of game dev, coming back to the basics of what games are: the art and the technology.

<TextStyled fontWeight="bold">What is next for gaming?</TextStyled>

The current perception of what will shape the gaming industry in the near future are _Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR)_, _Cloud Gaming_, _AI Generated Content_ and _Virtualized Geometry_[^17][^18]. All of those technologies are already being implemented in some form or another, but the casual majority is not yet fully exposed to them, and it might be _cross-play_ and _blockchain_ that will come to prominence sooner. Both of those innovations were identified by us to be critical for the industry in 2020's and onwards.

### Cross-play

**Cross-play** or cross-platform play, the ability for players to play against others who are using different gaming hardware to theirs
Following the notion of cross-platform development, cross-play is now achievable and can be implmented by using industry standart tooling like Unreal Engine 4 or Unity, however it implies a certain degree of engineering complexity and it is not available "out-of-the-box"[^5].
However, despite the fact that this is a feature that the players might value, the correct implementation demands an extensive research in regards to disadvatages that one group of player would have over another, as well as the possible issues with cross-platform compatibility. First-person shooter (FPS) is the prime example of a genre where cross-play adds up balancing challenges as PC gamers using a computer mouse have inherently precise aiming mechanics compared to the controller users. However, games with simplistic controls schemes or casual (non-competitive) titles might not be affected by this issue.

### Blockchain Gaming

6. outro - blockchain values & future of gaming -->

In 2000's it became evident that gaming is more than just an alternative to watching a movie or reading a book.
First, whole communities we're created around games that allowed for modifications, and games we're changed to the liking of their players, starting with very basic customization and coming to that point where brand new games we're built by enthusiasts on top of original titles.
And this was followed by the possiblity to trade in-game assets for a multiplayer game with other players, even for fiat currency took gaming beyond just a form of entertainment, it became a market of markets.
The reality where communities are able to shape the end-product is inherent to gaming, starting with decentralized MMO guilds and modding communites, and now blockchain is the next logical step in that direction through redefining the concepts of ownership and stakeholding.

**Blockchain** has become an omnipresent term that encompasses a social promise and a new technology, defining the whole sector of cryptocurrency and decentralized applications (dApps).
And due to it's expansive growth and unbounded disruptive potential, blockchain is often getting compared to the internet of the early 1990s[^11][^12].
The first implementation of blockchain came along with _Bitcoin_, the first real cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin's original developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, aimed to create an electronic payment system based on verifiable cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party[^9]. Satoshi described “blocks” and “chains” as a way of organizing and securing records, such that once entries had been made into a shared ledger, they become irreversible and mathematically provable[^10].

In the advent of Bitcoin's success, the potential of blockchain beyond only a value transfer vehicle has become evident.
It's fundamental values, specifically: trustlessness, permissionlessness, immutability and distributed autonomous ownership[^13], became the basis of new infrastructural protocols, notably _Ethereum_, which besides a decentralized payment system features Turing complete language, allowing for development of a wide variety of **Smart Contracts** on the blockchain. Once deployed on the blockchain, valid smart contracts are executed in accordance with their contractural terms, automatically enforcing the computed results on all involved accounts[^28][^30].

The substantial flexibility of smart contracts lead to creation of several new concepts:

<div className="pseudo-table">
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header" style={{minWidth: '4rem'}}>DeFi</p>
		<p>
			<b>Decentalized Finance</b> - Open and efficient financial ecosystem
		</p>
	</div>
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header" style={{minWidth: '4rem'}}>NFT</p>
		<p>
			<b>Non-Fungible Tokens</b> - Verifiebly unique digital assets
		</p>
	</div>
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header" style={{minWidth: '4rem'}}>DAO</p>
		<p>
			<b>Decentralized Autonomous Organization</b> - Virtual entities governed through on-chain code
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

Since it's inception, blockchain was associated primarely with financial and infrastructural applications, but in 2021, **blockchain** (or **crypto**) **gaming** and **NFT trade** have emerged as the new faces of the industry, where due to their intristic gamification their user base and subsequent user activity have had an enormous growth, quicky surpasing any other blockchain sub-sector[^23].

For reference, _Axie Infinity_, the most popular blockchain game at this moment, has made an immense leap from a niche game to a global phenomenon coming from 1,800 active players in August of 2020 to 1,500,000 daily active users in August of 2021, topping Bitcoin’s all-time high of 1.36M daily active wallets[^14].

The impact on Ethereum ecosystem, de facto the "to-go" blockchain for everything NFT and gaming related[^24], can be gauged by revenues the top projects bring, as well as the total amount of _gas_ (cost to execute a transaction on Ethereum) they use. In August 2021, the largest NFT marketplace _OpenSea_ and Axie Infinity added up to 87% of Ethereum revenues and topped the list of Ethereum's gas burning projects, significantly rising the cost of using the blockchain itself[^31].

What separates NFT and blockchain gaming from traditional to crypto financial instruments is the premise that NFT and gaming go beyond mathematics, offering now entertainment and sentimental values as well[^15].
The verifiable scarity, uniqueness and artistic merit of NFTs, make them along with blockchain gaming an excelent on-ramp for new people to world blockchain, proving that blockchain uses extend far beyond being a cryptocurrency bedrock[^16][^26].

<TextStyled fontWeight="bold">Evolution of Blockchain Gaming</TextStyled>

Soon after Bitcoin's initial release first games utilizting the technology started to appear, the varying level of implementation of the underlying innovations warrants categorizing them into generations (often running in parallel).

<div className="pseudo-table">
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header">Generation 0</p>
		<p>
		The earliest form of blockchain gaming known as <i>crypto-gaming</i> utilized cryptocurrencies for payments, or as a form of rewards system (precursor to <i>play-to-earn</i>). The initial wave were Bitcoin focused gambling games and simple boardgames. as well as some <i>Minecraft</i> servers and indie games. After some degree of success, the increasing inaccessiblity of Bitcoin, caused by it's price and transaction costs going up, made most of those games financially unviable, and projects had to close or pivot away from using Bitcoin.
		The significance of those first cryptogaming experiments is in their nature of combining blockchain and entertainment, proving the possiblility of having those two concepts running along.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header">Generation 1</p>
		<p>
		The first blockchain gaming generation is characterized by the adoption of blockchain beyond a payment system. A major leap in innovation was <i>Huntercoin</i>, a custom blockchain with mining coming from the players themselves who had to run a Huntercoin node to be able to interact with the game and earn tradeable HUC token. 
		<i>Motocoin</i> take the concept even further with "proof-of-play", where blockchain consensus was achieved through players solving blockchain generated puzzles for MOTO token rewards, yet it's demise came due to bot frontrunning players by being simply faster in solving those puzzles.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In 2017, <i>Cryptopunks</i> launched as the first algorithically generated NFT collection, and with the subsequent release of <i>Cryptokitties</i> that had the same premise but also possibility to "breed" new kitties, gaming was effectivelly brought to Ethereum, albeit rudimentary.
		The following projects, mainly collectibe NFT card games, allowed for the Player-vs-Player matches, and <i>Axie Infinity</i> elevated it further by reintroducing Play-to-Earn, done in a centralized manner with in-game token rewards. The possibility to earn income by playing a game has changed the meaning of gaming and what work can be, as people are now relying on casual gaming as the mean of providing for themselves.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The openness of blockchain, promoting unrestricted collaboration, led to creation of an interconnected blockchain <b>metaverse</b> including derivative projects and applications, as well as infrastructure/platform tooling. 
		However, with token ownership being predominantely the single distributed feature of those projects, the lack of transparency and decentralization limit collaboration and therefore the possible innovation.
		<br/>
		And the upcoming titles from renowned traditional gamedev studios featuring NFTs match fit in this category as well.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header">Generation 2</p>
		<p>
		The next generation of blockchain games differs from it's predecessors with the core organizational structure, where now DAOs take place of traditional game dev companies, allowing for decentralized ownership of the project itself. DAO tokens can be vaguely compared to company's shares, with governance and economic value now being shared between all the tokenholders. Projects combine gaming with cryptoeconomic elements of DeFi, such as token staking/liquidity providing, and together with the reality of blockchain's open markets and play-to-earn, those projects are set to revolutionalize the concept of game development and value creation. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		There is still some degree of centralization, notably servers, NFT metadata (what NFT essentially is) and non-Smart Contract NFT emission being handled by a single group. And with the intristic nature of blockchain that implies openness and innovation we can expect project to continue pushing for decentralization and sustainability.
		<br/>
		The examples of projects that embrace the principles outlined for second generation blockchain gaming are <i>Illuvium</i> and <i style={{color: "var(--ifm-color-primary)"}}>Hyperblade</i> 
		<br/>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div className="pseudo-table-row">
		<p className="pseudo-table-row-left-header">Generation 3</p>
		<p>
		The rather theoretical third generation is about elevating the degree of experimenation of what is possible with blockchain. 
		Fully driven by the community, and distributed from the start, projects like <i>Loot</i> change the meaning of what gaming actually means. 
		Loot is a pre-generated NFT collection of text files naming fantasy based gear with no gameplay whatsoever, and it's the community that decides what to do with the items, utilizing them to build new project on top in a permissionless and entirely community-powered way.
		Open-source mentality and trustlessess are allowing for an unprecedented level of innovation to happen, and with the latest advancements in blockchain tooling, notably fast and affordable transactions and distributed server-less computing and storage, we an expect more projects to be developed in this manner.
		However, the experimental nature of full decentralization is not suitable for every gaming project, as the technology is very raw and the artistic and entertainment core values often conflict with blockchain principles.

<TextStyled fontWeight="bold">Benefits of blockchain vs. traditional gaming</TextStyled>

_Blockchain-based game design_ touches the value construction principles and organizational structures of game development as we know it.
Traditional studios are hesitant to adapt decentralized in-game asset ownership and trustless access, evident by a lack of mainstream games built with blockchain and alternate organization structures (e.g. flat/distributed organization structure), ignoring the possible advantages blockchain gaming might bring both for the developers and the end-users.

**Blockchain Asset Ownership**
NFTs, like any other on-chain tokens, are stored in web3 wallets like _Metamask_, fully managed the wallet holder.
Smart Contract sets the boudaries of what can the original asset creator can do, as well as enable for advanced functionality like ongoing royalties collection, permitted mutation, or asset expiration date.

All possible ways of interacting with items like trading, sharing, staking or gambling further drive their entertainment and economic values.

**Transparency and Accountability**
On-chain Smart Contracts are completely transparent for all involved parties, and their integrity is guaranteed by the security of the blockchain itself.
Tokens (cryptocurrencies and NFTs) have provable legitimate ownership and limited supply, and smart contract based protocol governance naturally leads to high accountability.

**Access to Entire Blockchain Ecosystem**
The inherent openness of blockchain accommodates for free flow of capital and ideas.
And on-chain projects are exposed to such enabling concepts like _Liquidity Providing & Staking_, _Retroactive Funding_, or _On-Chain Lending_, inaccessible for traditional entitites.
The arrival of decentralized computing and storage will further

**On-chain Transactions**
The blockchain transfers are fast, cheap and have broad range of applications.
And whether it's a payment or a distribution system, the role of rent-seeking middlemen is minimized and therefore a higher financial efficiency is achieved.

**Play-to-Earn**
The opportunity to earn real life income by playing a game fundamentally changes the value building principles. Players are rewarded with tokenized currencies for their time and effort participating in the game economy, thus providing value for the developer and other players.

**Non-traditional Organizational Structures**
On-chain governance (including voting) and openness of blockchain allow for non-linear and distributed organizational structures (as well as ownership), democratizing the process of creation and leading to open and unrestrained innovation and collaboration

**Collaboration with Other Projects**
Interoperability between protocols elevates collaboration. Assets being in the custody of their true owners empowers third-party developers to build on top of existing asset bases. One item can be part of multiple different games, with the permission of it's owner. Tokenized economy with DeFi elements enables free flow of capital and further collaboration between projects, stimulating

However, blockchain gaming faces a number of **critiques**, both industry specific, and as the consequence of being in the larger blockchain-cryptocurrecy space:

- Blockchain scalability issues
- Wallet accessibility and end-user securuty concerns
- Economy-specific wealth inequality coming from transaction costs
- The _perceived_ materialibilty of non-fungible tokens leading to impossibility of smooth and frictionless transactions due to gas costs
- Asset ownership being pseudo-true, not being legally validated outside of the game
- Abundance of tokens resolving in their valuelessness[^7]
- Environement impact of blockchain economies [^8]

### Conclusions

In the video game industry, implementation of _digital open innovation_ , a distributed innovation process enabled and facilitated by digital technology and digitalization, together with leveraging user communities as information and innovation sources, leads to superior outcomes in long-term performance at the product level[^4].
And due to the nature of this industry, significant innovations rarely go unnoticed. Developers of various sizes evaluate the successses of their peers and adjust accordingly.

We are ought to see the impact of cross-play and blockchain, both being highly promising. But with blockchain being on the verge of it's cambrian explosion, there is an extraordinary opportunity for any developer to adapt and be amongst the first pioneers in perhaps the most revolutionary technology since the Internet.

## Core concept

_
**Hyperblade** is a competitive free-to-play sword fighting game, as well as a way for players to get real life income by playing the game they like.
_

But we are not developing only a game, Hyperblade is a whole new ecosystem built around the idea that players are much more than just a source of revenue. We took a brand new approach of putting together decentralization and openness of blockchain with a game that is actually fun to play. The organization behind the project is Hyperblade DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. This is a new type of entity that puts the community in the forefront, _creating incentives and a sound framework for thousands of people to organize without the need for formal roles or hiearchy_[^6].

The backbone of **Hyperblade DAO** (and therefore the Hyperblade ecosystem) is **Spacerock** **($SPR)** ERC-20 token. The DAO governance and revenues are all equally shared between the $SPR tokenholders.

## The Game

**Hyperblade** is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines our world with the world of sci-fi. The result is an original and compelling narrative revolving around martial arts and melee weapons. We want players to be fans not only of the game, but of the whole Hyperblade universe itself.

A group of erudites called _‘The Architects’_ has been pushing the progress of the human race for centuries. Now in the distant future, human race is at that point where their technology is basically magic-like. The culmination of Architects' efforts was them synthesizing a new universe in a quantum experiment. After analyzing all of the data, they determine that the universe they created is the polar opposite to their own universe. In shock, they realize that this negative universe is a vessel for them to be in while they got to create their own original universe. This means that in the physics world of Hyperblade, existence and time are in a loop. One universe creates the other, forming a chain dependency.

Architects move to the negative universe and establish there an idealized interplanetary society. Ancient philosophy, honor and martial arts are now an essential part of this space-faring civilization. The storyline is following a teenager from current day New York who was by throwed to this world by the forces unknown to him. He is discovering his power and abilities for melee combat in a quest of figuring out what is his role in this society and how he can get back home.

The game itself is a third-person fighter where players are dueling each other using various melee weapons ranging from katana swords to warhammers and halberds . The dynamics of the game can be compared to the likes of _Tekken_, _Mortal Kombat_ or _Super Smash Bros_. The simple control scheme makes Hyperblade accessible even for casual gamers. And at the same time, inputs being sharp and precise is what is making the game esports ready. Skill and knowledge of the game is how a player gets an edge over his opponents, pay-to-win is not applicable here.

## Blockchain

True blockchain gaming is the product of _Free-to-Play/Item Ownership/User driven developement_ trends in gamedev and _Decentralization/Permisionlessness/Determinism_ principles of the blockchain.

We want to change the belief that blockchain gaming is only about having NFTs and a tokenized currency. The value of blockchain gaming is in the ecosystem being fair to it's users who are now able to direct what direction their project is actually going.

**Hyperblade DAO** is the organization of **Spacerock token-holders**. Those are: players themselves, developers, various creatives, and people who just care about the success of the DAO (_or the token_). The initial governance is shared between core developers and seven voted-in councilmembers. This is not the final look of the DAO, the power will continue to shift to the most talented and highly driven community members. This time, it is the community that creates the product, and not the other way around.

The cornerstone of Hyperblade's complex economy is **Spacerock ($SPR)** token, issued and managed by Hyperblade DAO. Players earn Spacerock by directly playing the game, trading on the marketplace, or staking the token in a pool (and providing liquidity to the token, making it valuable outside of the HB ecosystem). The token serves two purposes: DAO voting and as a financial insturment. Token holders receive a share of revenues generated from the token usage as well as what they earn by staking. Revenue is coming from sales on Hyperblade marketplace (NFT & DLC), fees from NFT resales, and more.

**NFTs** were one of the main driving forces behind crypto this year (2021), bringing in enourmous revenues and drawing the best artistic talent. By changing the core concept of digital asset ownership, NFTs managed to show the mainstream what blockchain is truly about. Creatives gained a powerful outlet for their artistry as well as direct access to the profits this generates. For us, NFTs is how artists can participate in the making of Hyperblade by putting their creations in the game directly. Artists first submit their items for a community vote, then DAO approves and sends the best ones to the market. Now that creatives get a fair share from sale of their items, Hyperblade gets virtual museum quality NFTs that are actually usable in game. And usable means not only visible as vanity collectible cards, but items that players equip to battle their foes. _Start with a basic wooden Bokken and rise to the top with something like a Dark-matter Skimitar of Eternal Terror with the amount of 'slays' engraved on the blade._

One big issue that we're focusing on is accessibility, so besides the game being free-to-play, all blockchain activity is on L2. This means that the cost of dealing with NFTs is democratic and and not restrictive at all.

## Background

The development of Hyperblade started in 2019 then as the _'Project Blade,'_ by Drop Games Inc., a company founded by **Tim & Theo Born**. From Day 1 the goal was to create a game with a super low entry barrier, amazing replayablity and competitive edge. Blockchain brought a big twist on how the game is being made, as well as the fact that players can now be empowered to have a say and stake in the game they play. As of today (September 2021) the game is in it's alpha stage with full release scheduled for 2022.
