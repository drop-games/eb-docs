Combining the lessons learned from both gaming and blockchain industries, Hyperblade explores egalitarian, community-driven development cycle and fair value redistribution amongst both contributors and players. A Play-to-Earn system dubbed &quot;Duel-to-Earn&quot; allows Hyperblade to compensate active and competitive players for their time spent in the game, and thus keeping the multiplayer vibrant and engaging, with tokenized rewards in form of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. The community is able to earn, govern, and build through &quot;Hyperblade DAO&quot;, a decentralized blockchain-native organization with governance/monetary token &quot;Spacerock&quot;. The fundamental shift from centralized, opaque decision-making to distributed, meritocratic governance unlocks an entirely new plane of creativity and innovation, empowering the most talented and engaged individuals to contribute without restrictions imposed by a vertical organizational structure. By adopting open-source mentality and permissionless, uncensorable asset ownership through tokenization, the achieved artistic and technological advancements are available to the public instead of being tied to a single platform. As a public good, Hyperblade assets and infrastructure can be used as a foundation for new, independent projects, allowing for a positive reinforcement loops of innovation and enhanced utility, and thus increased intrinsic value, of the underlying assets. Our goal is to shift the paradigms of the artistic value creation, proving that a community-driven development approach is a sustainable way of developing highly artistic and innovative projects.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="new-approach-to-creative-labor"></a>New Approach to Creative Labor<a class="hash-link" href="#new-approach-to-creative-labor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong><a href="/Blockchain#Duel-to-Earn">&quot;Duel-To-Earn&quot;</a></strong>
The advent of internet and mobile technologies revolutionized the way we work, interact with each other and enjoy entertainment, elevating us beyond physical world into the world of virtual.</p><p>The moving force behind the internet were always the creative and curious people, who are able to innovate and build something that has never been seen before.
The economies of scale that come with world-wide reach and interconnectivity allow even small teams or even individuals to build enormous projects influencing millions, yet what often comes with first successes is shift towards the &quot;growth at all cost&quot; mentality that shapes the goals and values of those entities. With artistry and entertainment being the two defining traits of video gaming industry that has been big part of making internet as we know it, for-profit only approach has led only to the loss of integrity and innovation, and as the end result, disappointed fan-bases. This has been a logical outcome for the majority of companies primarily operating on the internet, and until recently there was no alternative for this.</p><p><strong>Blockchain</strong>, posed to be one of the focal points of the internet in the 2020s, enables us to go over the obstacles caused by legacy mindset, and go towards decentralization, permissionlessness and immutability, where economies of scale start to work for the people instead of against them.</p><p>However, even with blockchain technologies societal anti-patterns transcend innovation, as witnessed by the abuse of Web3 technologies and the extensive scams in the NFT space.</p><p>We believe that at the heart of blockchain lies the answer to many real-world infrastructure problems, and so our goal with this project is to explore the potential ways generative people can come together to collaborate on complex interdisciplinary projects, building what has to be built for the good of everyone, and not just the few.</p><p><em><a href="/Appendix">Appendix</a> section features an elaborate analysis of blockchain gaming and it&#x27;s history, as well as the role of innovation in the video gaming industry.
</em></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="the-game"></a>The Game<a class="hash-link" href="#the-game" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>Hyperblade</strong> is an online third-person fighter focusing on player-vs-player melee combat, designed for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. The game is distributed for free online, where accounts are tied to Web3 wallet ownership.
The premise of the game is competitive nature of the fighter genre,
where the dynamics can be compared to the likes of <em>Tekken</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> or <em>Super Smash Bros</em>,
and the community-first approach, building the value in and out of the game.
The game itself is situated in a new fantasy universe that combines real world with the world of sci-fi, presented through a series of lore building singleplayer chapters. The result is an original and compelling narrative carrying entertainment value just by itself.
Yet the primary game mode is Duel-to-Earn rewards supplemented <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, players are competing for better ranks and rewards with similarly skilled opponents in matchmaker arranged duels. Duel-to-Earn system features rewards multipliers, cooldowns and penalties, all intended to balance out yields throughout the playerbase in a sustainable and transparent manner.
Furthermore, players are encouraged to join dedicated servers that feature custom game modes, including available on launch 32 player servers with social features like challenging for a duel and NFT betting/staking.</p><p>What distinguishes Hyperblade as a fighter game from its predecessors is the native support for <strong>cross-play</strong>.
The mechanics of the game give no explicit advantage to either platform, PC, console and mobile players can all duel against each other on equal grounds, enabling for the real cross-play with no compromises.
The fundamentally simple control scheme is what makes Hyperblade accessible even for casual gamers yet at the same time sharp and precise inputs allow for competitive gameplay and eventual emergence of esports.
In Hyperblade, skill and knowledge of the game is how a player gets an edge over his opponents, the purchasable items have no effect on the game balance.</p><p>The diversity of the gameplay, augmented by vast playstyle and appearance options, wide array of playable maps and game modes, is essential to high replayability and real entertainment value. Hyperblade is set to be a continuously evolving ecosystem, prioritizing satisfaction of it&#x27;s userbase, balanced wealth distribution and free-flowing innovation and creativity.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="blockchain"></a>Blockchain<a class="hash-link" href="#blockchain" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hyperblade is a part of <em>Ethereum</em> ecosystem and utilizes blockchain for governance, in-game economy, item ownership and player authentication. The cornerstone of Hyperblade&#x27;s complex economy are <strong>Spacerock</strong> and <strong>Timeore</strong> ERC-20 tokens. The primary user-facing blockchain activity is conducted on <em>Layer 3</em> of Ethereum<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, providing users with secure, fast and cost-effective access to the platform.</p><p>Hyperblade is developed by <strong><a href="/Governance">Hyperblade DAO</a></strong>, a decentralized organization of <strong>Spacerock token-holders</strong> who govern using an egalitarian token-based voting system.
During the early stages of development where core infrastructure and base game is being built, the governance will be shared between core developers (<strong>Drop Games Inc.</strong>) and seven elected council members, who in turn vote openly on pending proposals submitted by the community. Striving for long-term sustainability and prioritizing interests of the community, the DAO will gradually adopt decentralized governance, potentially even moving away from token balance-based voting.</p><p>The proposition behind Hyperblade DAO is to give the community a platform to participate in world-building, development and revenue redistribution.
Furthermore, the possibility to earn for contributing via grants, completing dev bounties or by generally having a positive impact on the ecosystem allows Hyperblade to be built from within, creating a positive feedback loop and fairly rewarding the actors both financially and in terms of influence over the platform.
By giving incentives and building collaboration framework without formal roles or hierarchy the DAO can empower the most talented and highly driven community members, ensuring that Hyperblade and its ecosystem will evolve in the best possible way.</p><p><strong><a href="/Blockchain">Spacerock ($SPR)</a></strong> serves as the primary monetary and governance token of Hyperblade, and has a fixed supply of <strong>10,000,000 $SPR</strong>, released in a transparent and controlled manner.
Spacerock serves as the basis for revenue redistribution, with revenue coming from sales on <strong>Hyperblade Marketplace</strong> (NFT &amp; DLC), fees from peer-to-peer commerce, and other DAO initiatives.
$SPR further allows for advanced DeFi interactivity, for instance DAO arranged <strong>Staking</strong> and <strong>Liquidity Providing</strong> give $SPR holders an opportunity to earn passive income in form of additional $SPR and NFT rewards.</p><p><strong><a href="/Blockchain#timeore">Timeore ($TMO)</a></strong> is a <strong>Duel-to-Earn</strong> reward token received by players for their time and effort contributing to the Hyperblade economy by playing the game, and therefore building up online activity and competitiveness. Interactions are quantified in the form of Timeore reward and released to the appropriate Web3 account/wallet.
The core utility that gives Timeore its intrinsic value is the possibility to burn it and perform certain actions not available otherwise. For example, opening <strong>NFT Loot Crates</strong>, upgrading items or entering exclusive tournaments.
With rewards being undoubtedly a major motivator for many players, Hyperblade DAO has to take a sustainable approach of fairly and accurately distributing Timeore and NFT Loot Crates between an unbounded amount of participants. The token issuance is continuous in accordance with the rate set by the DAO.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="nft"></a>NFT<a class="hash-link" href="#nft" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Together with Spacerock and Timeore, <strong><a href="/NFT">NFTs</a></strong> are the essential to decentralized asset ownership in Hyperblade.
Tied to Web3 accounts/wallets, Hyperblade items are in the full custody of their respective holders, allowing for provably unrestricted and uncensorable interactivity, guaranteed by the integrity of the blockchain.</p><p>Obtained either by opening <a href="/NFT#loot-crates--item-rarity">Loot Crates</a>, on Hyperblade Marketplace, or through air drops, <a href="/NFT#nft-types">NFTs are utilized</a> directly in-game in form of weapons, armor, and cosmetics.
Items come in 7 rarity tiers with an increasing level of uniqueness and in-game features implying higher valuations of the rarest items.
Furthermore, the exhaustive customization/personalization, seen both by the owner and the rest of the players, serves the purpose of making each play session an one-of experience.
The key distinction between digital items of already established gaming franchises and Hyperblade items is the native blockchain integration of Hyperblade items/NFTs, giving them utility even <em>outside</em> of the game.
Other than being available in the <strong><a href="/NFT#hyperblade-nft-viewer-app">Hyperblade NFT Viewer App</a></strong>, on-chain activities like <em>lending, fractionalizing, wagering etc.</em> are not only possible, but rather encouraged, as those essentially increase the intrinsic value of the items.
The cross-application interoperability, including open on-chain metadata access, enables HB NFTs to be the basis for third-party projects and collections as well. Hyperblade NFTs are therefore positioned to be fully <strong>Metaverse</strong> integrated.</p><p>The underlying artistic side of the NFTs allow them to be the grounds for creative expression of the community. Artists submit their created NFT art, for instance a sword or a character skin, to a community vote, items that passed the vote are then available in-game and Hyperblade Marketplace. Creatives then get a fair share from the profits from the NFTs they created, and Hyperblade gets museum quality pieces directly available in the game.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="open-sourcing"></a>Open Sourcing<a class="hash-link" href="#open-sourcing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Along with security and reliability, it was the openness and unrestricted innovation that made Web3/crypto space what it is now.
Open sourcing and free flow of ideas allow small teams to build monumental projects that would be impossible to make without the ability to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p><p>Hyperblade, as a blockchain native project, is being built with similar values.
The planned functionality requires an extensive amount of engineering, where the technology is being developed using the available open-source code and through the collaboration with other teams, e.g. using open-source <em>Uniswap V2 Interface</em> to build decentralized Hyperblade exchange. Hyperblade DAO acknowledges that it in the common interest to share the acquired knowledge, and therefore all source code will be made available in the open, combining GPLv3 licensing for common components such as Marketplace, DEX or governance modules, and delayed open-sourcing via BSL for Hyperblade&#x27;s artistic part with 3 year closed-source period.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer<a class="hash-link" href="#disclaimer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This white paper serves the purpose of introducing reader to the core concepts of <em>Hyperblade</em> and <em>Hyperblade DAO</em>.
