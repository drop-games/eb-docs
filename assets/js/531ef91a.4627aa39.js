The sole cause of this is a centralized economy that is fully controlled by the developer coming with only one official point of sale and limited/forbidden item & account resale. What this boils to is an economy that has no price-regulation and infinite/unrestricted asset emission, which in turn can lead to an unexpected inflation and items then being worhtless. Those kind of in-game economies are also tied to one particular game (best case, a franchise), so the items are rendered useless outside of it.
