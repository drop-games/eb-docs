Combining the lessons learned from both gaming and blockchain industries, Hyperblade explores egalitarian, community-driven development cycle and fair value redistribution amongst both contributors and players. A Play-to-Earn system dubbed "Duel-to-Earn" allows Hyperblade to compensate active and competitive players for their time spent in the game, and thus keeping the multiplayer vibrant and engaging, with tokenized rewards in form of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. The community is able to earn, govern, and build through "Hyperblade DAO", a decentralized blockchain-native organization with governance/monetary token "Spacerock". The fundamental shift from centralized, opaque decision-making to distributed, meritocratic governance unlocks an entirely new plane of creativity and innovation, empowering the most talented and engaged individuals to contribute without restrictions imposed by a vertical organizational structure. By adopting open-source mentality and permissionless, uncensorable asset ownership through tokenization, the achieved artistic and technological advancements are available to the public instead of being tied to a single platform. As a public good, Hyperblade assets and infrastructure can be used as a foundation for new, independent projects, allowing for a positive reinforcement loops of innovation and enhanced utility, and thus increased intrinsic value, of the underlying assets.
