Our goal is to create a community-driven development cycle where all revenue proceeds are redistributed equitably amongst both community members that participate in active development of the project and the players that provide real-world value to the project by consuming the resulting product. Combining the lessons learned from both gaming and blockchain industries, Hyperblade augments the now common concept of Play-to-Earn in a fair redistribution system dubbed **["Duel-To-Earn"](Blockchain#Duel-to-Earn)**, promoting competitiveness and active participation essential for a multiplayer game to be vibrant and engaging. The community is able to earn, govern, and build the game through "Hyperblade DAO", a decentralized blockchain-native organization, supported by a governance/monetary token "Spacerock". The fundamental shift from opaque, centralized decision-making to distributed, community-first governance unlocks an entirely new plane of creativity and innovation, empowering the most talented and engaged individuals to contribute in an unrestricted manner without a managerial structure that often restricts artistic expression in favor of monetary gain. By adopting permissionless and uncensorable asset ownership through tokenization, and a open-source mentality with public infrastructure, artistic and technical advancements are not restricted to one particular platform or group of developers, including the original core developers. New projects can be build using Hyperblade assets and infrastructure, allowing for a positive reinforcement loops of innovation, and enhanced utility for the original assets, increasing their intristic value and rewarding the original creators of the assets. The end result: Hyperblade is a self-directed project that gives back to the community by directly rewarding Our goal is to shift the paradigms of the artistic value creation, proving that a community-driven development approach is a sustainable way of developing highly artistic and innovative projects.'),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"creative-labor-and-how-to-sell-thin-air"},"Creative Labor and How to sell thin air"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The advent of internet and mobile technologies revolutionized the way we work, communicate and enjoy entertainment.
