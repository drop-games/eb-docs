The gameplay is dynamic yet super competitive, and everything is built with cross-play in mind, so even mobile players can enjoy battling on the arenas of Hyperblade with relative ease.</p><p><em>Duel your opponents in a classic rounds system, you have 90 seconds in each round to defeat your opponent three times. Or try any different game mode, maybe even a social one where you just hang out with your friends in the dojo. Play even offline versus bots or in the singleplayer campaigns.</em></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="key-mechanics"></a>Key Mechanics<a class="hash-link" href="#key-mechanics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hyperblade puts a heavy emphasis on letting players find their own individualistic fighting style, and the overall game design reflects that. To allow the players to build their own style, the game lets players to choose a combination of a character and a sword type. Each of which adds their distinctive augmentations to the overall gameplay experience.</p><p>Each character has a set of unique attack moves and an one-of gameplay ability. The attacks are separated into 3 attack stances: the light, medium, and heavy stance. Characters have different number of attacks in every stance, e.g. a &#x27;nimble&#x27; character would have more light attacks than a &#x27;tank&#x27; character. Attacks then can be chained into a combo. And combos can contain attacks from any stance.</p><img src="/../static/img/game/Combos-light-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--light_3UqQ" style="width:30rem;max-width:100%"><img src="/../static/img/game/Combos-dark-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--dark_hz6m" style="width:30rem;max-width:100%"><br><span style="color:var(--ifm-color-primary);font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">Example of a combo chain going from heavy attack to medium to light and back to medium</span><br><br><p>Stances also have different properties. Heavy attacks are slower while dealing more damage. A light attack is fast, but deals low amounts of damage, while a medium attack is a balanced one.</p><p>The concept of stances gives us the ability to include a large variety of different attacks in the game. Players then can pick and choose different attack animations, chaining them together into a unique attack combo. Players will eventually discover which combo chains are favourable against other combo chains, allowing for a great depth of skill as each attack move has its own distinctive animation, and thus direction and timing.</p><p>Different stances combined with the physically-based sword-fighting of Hyperblade also allows for interesting combat mechanics such as parries. When two swords collide a heavy attack wins over a medium attack, a medium attack wins over a light attack, and the air attack wins over the heavy attack. This creates a circular dependency between all of the attacks, ensuring that each attack can be countered if the player is skilled enough.</p><p>Characters are the base for stance system, but they also have have individual properties such as attack speed, movement speed and size. Coupled with the selection of a sword type, which also augments gameplay, the combat variability and playstyle customization in Hyperblade becomes substantial.</p><br><img src="/../static/img/game/Combos2-light-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--light_3UqQ" style="width:40rem;max-width:100%"><img src="/../static/img/game/Combos2-dark-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--dark_hz6m" style="width:40rem;max-width:100%"><br><span style="color:var(--ifm-color-primary);font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">The same combo chain from the above, expressed as a series of inputs on a PS5</span><br><br><span style="color:inherit;font-size:1.3rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">Directionality</span><br>One of the key elements of combat is directionality.<p>Because weâ€™re generating attack collision based on the animation of the characters, the directionality of attacks comes into play. Different animations have different directionality of attacks, which means in order to parry an attack successfully a player has to be aware of the direction than an incoming attack is taking and counter it with an attack that has an intersecting trajectory. This sort of gameplay is very reminiscent of titles such as <em>Mordhau</em> or <em>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</em>, where players have to aim their sword attacks and use the right attack direction to successfully parry an attack or to get through the opponentsâ€™ defence and inflict a damaging hit. To capitalize on this interesting nature of directionality, we decided to implement it as one of the features of movement mechanic, this is done by adding a left attack and a right attack to each stance. When the player is standing still or moving forward, stance forward combo attacks are selected.</p><span style="color:inherit;font-size:1.3rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">Attack Charge and Tiers</span><br>When play-testing Hyperblade early, one big problem arose pretty quickly: kiting opponents indefinitely and having no incentive to attack the opponent when on the losing end. Thatâ€™s why we introduced the concept of attack charging. Attack charging incentivizes the player to run at the opponent and be the first to attack, as a higher charged attack always wins the parry. This means that the first player to charge an attack is put into an offensive position, while the opposing player is put into a defensive position. The defensive player then has the choice of counter-attacking, blocking or trying to avoid the attack.<p>We extended the concept of charged attacks by introducing charge tiers. Charge tiers augment the attack based on how fully charged the attack is. Tier 1 is the base attack, Tier 2 is a middle ground defined in the character properties, and Tier 3 is a fully charged attack. In order to charge an attack, the player has to hold down the attack button. The player character emits visible visual cues to signify how charged the player is. When a player charges an attack fully, the attack will automatically play at a Tier 3 level. Tier 3 attacks also serve the purpose of being able to break through the block of the opposing player.</p><span style="color:inherit;font-size:1.3rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">Parries and Block</span><br>Physicality and Directionality of attacks raise the obvious question of what happens when two swords collide; we call this event a â€˜Parry.â€™ When a player parries another attack the attack with the higher charge tier has the advantage. The player that wins the parry has a faster recovery time, allowing a bigger time window to counter-attack the opponent. If two players parry with the same charge tier, the parry is neutral and both players have the same recovery time and thus time delay between allowing an attack input to go through.<p>The player is also equipped with a block mechanic, which effectively blocks any incoming attacks and projectiles. The block has a certain â€˜breakâ€™ damage threshold. If a player is spamming the block button constantly, itâ€™s very easy for the opponent to break his block by breaking the threshold. On top of that, fully charged Tier 3 attacks instantly break any blocks or parries of lesser stances. This way we ensure that blocks are only used as a last resort option to dodge an incoming attack.8</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="controls"></a>Controls<a class="hash-link" href="#controls" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hyperblade is built with real cross-play in mind. And the key principle is that controls are optimized for both PC and console gaming. Furthermore, the control scheme allows even for mobile gaming without serious disadvantages.
The way we achieve that is by putting complex game mechanics and a huge amount of unique attack animations behind a very simple input layout. The next figure shows how controls look on each platform.</p><p>The controls are meant to be responsive, intuitive, and snappy, while at the same time being simple enough that they can be mapped easily to any platform. Following schema show how controls are mapped to example targeted platforms.</p><img src="/../static/img/game/Controls-light-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--light_3UqQ" style="width:40rem;max-width:100%"><img src="/../static/img/game/Controls-dark-mode.png" alt="Combos graph" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--dark_hz6m" style="width:40rem;max-width:100%"><br><span style="color:var(--ifm-color-primary);font-size:0.8rem;font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit;font-family:inherit;line-height:inherit;text-shadow:inherit;text-transform:inherit;text-decoration:inherit">PC/console/mobile controls schematics</span><br><br><p>In order to maximize player engagement and retention, we are building up gameplay complexity behind the veil of extremely simple arcade-like controls. High replayability is achieved as a result of the uniqueness of each of the player matchups, where each player has the choice of a character and a sword type. And on top of the already complex stance and parry system, the addition of character abilities, sword types and freedom of movement augment the possibilites of each mach being completely unique and to never be repeated again.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="customization"></a>Customization<a class="hash-link" href="#customization" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Customization does not stop at the gameplay level, characters have rich visual customization as well. There are many visual attributes on each character that can be changed to players liking. This allows players to express themselves and give their avatars a sense of personalization.</p><p>There is a certain amount of slots on character models that can be used. The elements can be armor pieces, clothes or even auras, victory animation emotes and such. However, the most important feature is sword customization.</p><p>Players start with a default Bokken sword (think wooden katana) and as they progress the swords get fancier up to the levels where one can end up with super rare like Demonic Claymore of Doom or such. There are multiple types of swords available in the game, each has it&#x27;s own unique parameters and plays differently than the others. Because of the distinctions like speed, damage and reach, players have to see what works the best with the character they use, because their opponents will definitely do the same.</p><p>The way we implement core customization is by going with on-chain NFTS. Those NFTs can be obtained during the playthrough or on the Hyperblade Marketplace. How does it all work is described in <a href="/NFT">NFT</a> section.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="visuals--setting"></a>Visuals &amp; Setting<a class="hash-link" href="#visuals--setting" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Being a free-to-play, cross-platform fighting game, Hyperblade is a game built with mass appeal in mind. Our goal is to create a brand new universe that captivates a wide array of audiences while retaining a lot of depth, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve made several conscious decisions about the game design.</p><p>Hyperblade utilizes a stylized artstyle, which makes it very visually appealing and readable, the later is especially important for competitive gameplay. Another advantage of the stylized approach is that it allows us to have a streamlined art pipeline, where we&#x27;re able to make new assets effectively without losing any of the aesthetic value. The stylized graphics look great even on lower end platforms or mobile, which makes again game truly accessible for all. Finally, we want Hyperblade to be played without any visual discomfort even many years after the release, so having the graphics that will stand the test of time is essential. <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is our benchmark in regards to longetivity, and the stylized artstyle and built in-trading platform are perhaps the reasons why this 14 year old game is just as popular as ever.</p><p>The setting is in an alternate-reality world, meaning we use the real world as the base and create something on top, bringing a brand new story-driven universe to life (just like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, or <em>Soul Calibur</em> do). This provides us with a very good framework not limited by the setting of any existing franchise, yet it also gives us a way to tie real-world cultural references to our game. As a fighting game revolving around melee combat, real-life martials like kendo or fencing could now be implemented in our character lore.</p><img src="../static/img/game/inspirationboard.png" alt="Inspiration Board"><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="story"></a>Story<a class="hash-link" href="#story" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Our story starts in the distant future, where human race is in such an advanced state that their technology is indistinguishable from magic. The group of top sciencists known as &#x27;The Architects&#x27; are at that level where they are able to alter the state of time and matter. In one of their experiments they created a brand new universe, which in turn of events was acknowledged to be the &#x27;opposite universe&#x27;. As architects realize the purpose of it, they have to migrate to it to be able to create the original universe they were from. This creates a loop, where one universe creates the other one and vice versa.</p><p>To fulfill their goals and they have to create a new society spanning multitude of star systems. This society is built on a certain set of values that Architects deem the best for the purpose of doing their research. Honor, martial arts and ancient philosophy are the key values that the whole <em>Mirror Society</em> is following.</p><p>The plot of the first chapter of Hyperblade reveloves around a teenager from today&#x27;s New York City and his adventures in the Mirror Society. The events begin with him being ambushed in his home city by a group of presumed assassins all wielding &#x27;shadowy&#x27; swords. While trying to escape, protagonist finds himself surrounded and seemingly doomed, but all of a sudden a sword appears in the ground, and as the last desperate attempt to survive, the main protagonist grabs it and suddenly disappears.</p><p>After waking up all confused, he thinks this was just a bad dream, but it&#x27;s not his bed where he finds himself. He is now in <em>Mirror Society</em> and his life will never be the same like before. The first chapter is about his self-discovery and understanding where he is and what is his purpose. His newfound skills in sword fighting put him right on the track to reach the top of the social ladder and find out what is this all about.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="weapon-types"></a>Weapon Types<a class="hash-link" href="#weapon-types" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hyperblade just like the name suggests focuses primarily on sword-based combat. And there are multiple types of swords like one handed swords, claymores, katanas and more. Again, each sword has different game parameters like attack speed, damage it inflicts or reach. For player&#x27;s familiarity the way we implement weapon types is by grouping them loosely together, so players know what they expect from using a skimitar vs a katana.</p><p>During the development we discovered that while sword fights are fun, there could be more to it. So besides swords we already have <strong>hammers and maces</strong> already in Hyperblade, which brings another layer of game dynamics and complexity. And there are also other types of weaponry currently in works. The next iteration of Hyperblade will come with <strong>spears</strong>, and in the future we want to bring halberds, crescent swords or flails.</p><p>To further enhance the gameplay and they way duels work, we introduce limited <strong>ranged</strong> combat. This is done to prevent ultra passive combat where one player just plainly evades his opponent. The way it&#x27;s implemented is by giving a minor ability to every character to launch a projectile. It could be a ninja star, a throwing knife, or even something more exotic like a self-guiding mini drone etc.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="seasons-ranked--esports"></a>Seasons, Ranked &amp; Esports<a class="hash-link" href="#seasons-ranked--esports" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hyperblade takes its pride on being a very balanced and competitively aimed game. The gameâ€™s learning curve is moderately steep, allowing both beginners and professionals to enjoy the game and test their skills against other players at irregardless of the expertise level, including competitively. The basis for the competitive gameplay in Hyperblade is <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, this is where players will prove themselves against equally skilled opponents and climb the ranked ladder if they&#x27;re good enough.</p><p>To get into ranked, players must play 10 placement matches where they will be pitted with other fighters of varying skill level. After that, players get their first rank assigned based on their performance. From there on, Ranked mode will be unlocked and each match there will change player&#x27;s rating and therefore the kind of opponents they will face. There are 10 ranks planned, with each being progressivly more and more tough. The final rank will allow players to join Hyperblade DAO hosted tournaments with actual prize pools.</p><p>Competitive ranks are separate from the player level, and are reset each each <strong>Season</strong>. Seasons is how the online mode is kept fresh, each brings new content and changes to gameplay, including ranked. The duration of season varies on the stage of development of Hyperblade, shorter seasons can be expected in the beginning, the later seasons should not last longer than a year.</p><p>There are unique <strong>Rewards</strong> given out for playing ranked mode, as well as a chance to get a Loot Crate just like in casual mode. The chance that one gets a better reward is linearely increasing as the ranks are rising up. The top players can expect to get valuable NFTs that are impossible to get otherwise.</p><p>Esports is the logical evolution of ranked gameplay. The balance, fast pace and rich visuals are making both esports and regular streaming viable, giving the viewers feeling like they are the ones playing. We also plan on hosting several annual tournaments with prize pools. Those will be funded from the DAO treasury, sponsors and NFT ticket sales. Later on, tools for hosting custom tournaments will be released for all.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="other-gamemodes"></a>Other gamemodes<a class="hash-link" href="#other-gamemodes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The game will not be limited only to 1v1 duels. There are several game modes currently in the development that will enrich the players&#x27; experience. Starting with a social game mode that we call the Lounge, which allows dozens of players to join a single server and just hang out and chat. The upcoming modes will also focus on expanding base game, for example 3v3 MOBA style game mode that can later translate to a social</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/dropdao/hb-docs/docs/Game.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Introduction</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/Blockchain"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Blockchain &amp;
